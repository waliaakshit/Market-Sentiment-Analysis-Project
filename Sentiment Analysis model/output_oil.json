                  "description": "Bitcoin's dominance rate, or share of the total crypto market, has risen to its highest in almost two years while ether's stagnates.",
                  "content": "Omkar Godbole Omkar Godbole was a senior reporter on CoinDesk's Markets team. Follow @ godbole17 on Twitter Ethereum's highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade , also called the Shanghai-Capella hard fork, is set to occur Wednesday, after which users will have access to the $31 billion worth of ether ( ETH ) staked in the blockchain since December 2020. The upgrade has been widely hailed as long-term bullish for Ethereum's native token. Still, bitcoin ( BTC ), not ether, is outperforming the broader crypto market and becoming more dominant as the upgrade approaches. Bitcoin's dominance rate, which measures the largest cryptocurrency's share of crypto's total market valuation, rose to 48.5% early Tuesday, the highest since July 2021, according to data tracked by charting platform TradingView. The metric has risen by 15% this year. Ether's dominance rate remains stagnant between 19% and 20%. That compares with a rise to 21% from 14% in the weeks before a software upgrade last September known as the Merge . That technological overhaul replaced Ethereum's at-the-time energy-intensive proof-of-work mechanism of verifying transactions with a proof-of-stake system and set the stage for Shanghai. Staking involves depositing coins in the blockchain to boost the network's security and verify transactions in return for rewards. Investor caution in pricing ether ahead of Shanghai stems from several factors, including concerns tokens unlocked after the upgrade will flood the market and regulatory issues. \"The Shanghai upgrade will unlock over 18 million ether staked since late 2020. The market is worried that the unlocking may bring about a sell-off, causing uncertainty in the market,\" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader at crypto asset-management firm Blofin, told CoinDesk. Bitcoin's share in the total crypto market continues to rise, while ether's stagnates. (TradingView) (TradingView) While the upgrade will unlock more than 18 million ETH, only partial withdrawals of 1.1 million ETH \u2013 the coins earned as staking rewards \u2013 will be withdrawable immediately. Analysts have recently said that the partial withdrawals will take several days to process and the resulting selling pressure is unlikely to be significant. \"If all partial withdrawals are attempted just after the Shapella fork (which seems highly improbable), it would take around four and a half days for these ETH profits to enter the market,\" Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, wrote in a note published Friday. According to Outumuro, full withdrawals representing most of the ETH staked will take longer. \"It would take approximately 100 days for one-third of validators to exit if they all attempt to exit simultaneously, translating into $80-$100M worth of ETH being withdrawn per day. This would make up about 1% of ETH\u2019s daily trading volume, though it is unlikely that all withdrawals will be sold,\" Outumuro noted. The market, however, isn't convinced, as evident from ether's underperformance relative to bitcoin and ether put options, or bearish bets, drawing higher prices than call options. Regulatory concerns are probably also weighing on investors. In February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Ethereum staking services offered by centralized exchanges amount to selling unregistered securities in the U.S. \"ETH faces relatively higher regulatory risks. The SEC has repeatedly stated that ETH is a security rather than a commodity, which differs from the CFTC's opinion and means additional risk, so investors understandably prefer BTC,\" Ardern said, referring to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. agency that regulates the futures market. Lastly, recent banking sector instability in the U.S. and the resulting sharp repricing of interest-rate expectations lower worldwide has benefited bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has evolved as a macro asset in the past three years and has a history of drawing safe-haven bids during banking crises. \"BTC got the store-of-value narrative back after multiple U.S. banks failed in mid-March. Since then, BTC's dominance rate has been rising,\" Dubai-based crypto analyst and trader Ritika Malik said. Dominance rate is now at a \"multiyear resistance\" that has capped the upside in the past, meaning ether and other coins could soon outshine bitcoin, Malik said. \"By being concerned, the market is actually 'pricing in' already any selling pressure that we are likely to get from the Shanghai hard fork and the upgrade could actually become a 'buy-the-news' event,\" she added. \"BTC dominance chart is at a multiyear resistance as well as we speak. All the stars are aligning for a rotation into ETH.\" Edited by Sheldon Reback.

                  "content": "James Rubin James Rubin is CoinDesk's U.S. news editor based on the West Coast. Follow @ @JPRubin23 on Twitter For a while Monday, even as large parts of the world were off work celebrating Easter Monday, bitcoin (BTC) seemed headed for a promised land above $30,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which just three weeks ago had teased a run toward this threshold, topped $29,744 in the afternoon, its highest level since early June, amid a surge in investor optimism. But the cause of the move was difficult to pinpoint. It was currently trading at $29,616. From about 10 a.m to 11 a.m. ET (14:00-15:00 UTC), bitcoin rose nearly 4%. It had been lingering closer to $28,000 since mid-March, when fears about the conventional banking system began to diminish. \u201cThere isn't a clear catalyst for this spike,\u201d Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk, although he said that the surge might stem partly from \u201cbuying from crypto traders voicing frustration on social media over a one-sided New York Times article that took issue over [bitcoin's] energy consumption.\u201d Moya also noted that the move higher \u201coccurred around the release of news that Federal Home Loan Bank debt issuance had lessened, signaling that \u201cthe banking crisis was easing.\u201d Ether (ETH) also jumped, crossing the $1,900 level before retreating. It was recently up about 1.7% versus 24 hours earlier. Other major cryptos were largely in the green, albeit light shades. ARB, the token of layer 2 blockchain Arbitrum, was recently up more than 2.8%, while XRP rose about 1%. The CoinDesk Market Index , a measure of the crypto market's overall performance, recently rose 2.3%. Equity indexes closed roughly flat with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rising a few ticks of a percentage point, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite losing 0.03%. Crypto-related stocks enjoyed a memorable day with crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and corporate bitcoin vault MicroStrategy (MSTR) both rising more than 7.5%. Markets will be eyeing the March Consumer Price March Index (CPI) report this week for signs that inflation is continuing its recent trudge downward. In February, inflation in the U.S. slowed to 0.4% from 0.5% a month earlier and 6% on a yearly basis from 6.4% the previous month. Bitcoin jumped past $26,000 following that report, on March 14. A continued slowdown could embolden central bankers to scale back their year-long regime of harsh interest rate hikes, although the impact on bitcoin is uncertain. The crypto seemed to gain momentum following the recent U.S. bank failures that caused worries about the conventional financial system, as investors shifted toward assets that retain value through good times and bad. Investors will also be weighing the first wave of quarterly earnings with banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup scheduled to report results. Analysts are expecting a largely downcast quarter, particularly in the hard-hit financial services sector. \u201cBTC is also being seen as a reliable store of value that lacks the issues that come with storing your money by way of a third-party intermediary, or a bank,\u201d Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO and chief legal officer of Banxa , a payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider to the crypto industry, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. \u201cThis is further supported by the decreasing correlation with the equity markets since 2021 \u2013 BTC is now properly starting to be perceived as a risk-off asset.\u201d Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, was cautiously optimistic about the sustainability of bitcoin\u2019s Monday surge. \u201cBitcoin is likely to find resistance at $30,000,\u201d DiPasquale noted in an email to CoinDesk. From a technical-analysis perspective, the current move is \u201ca retest of the range high established in March after the initial surge from under $20,000. Success of this test would see the price claiming $30,000 while a failure here should see BTC drop to $25,000, followed by $23,000.\u201d But he added: \u201cThe current price is also testing the lows of July 2021, where the market bounced back into another big rally.\u201d UPDATE (April 10, 2023, 22:27 UTC): Updates with bitcoin's most recent prices.

                  "content": "Omkar Godbole Omkar Godbole was a senior reporter on CoinDesk's Markets team. Follow @ godbole17 on Twitter Ethereum's highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade , also called the Shanghai-Capella hard fork, is set to occur Wednesday, after which users will have access to the $31 billion worth of ether ( ETH ) staked in the blockchain since December 2020. The upgrade has been widely hailed as long-term bullish for Ethereum's native token. Still, bitcoin ( BTC ), not ether, is outperforming the broader crypto market and becoming more dominant as the upgrade approaches. Bitcoin's dominance rate, which measures the largest cryptocurrency's share of crypto's total market valuation, rose to 48.5% early Tuesday, the highest since July 2021, according to data tracked by charting platform TradingView. The metric has risen by 15% this year. Ether's dominance rate remains stagnant between 19% and 20%. That compares with a rise to 21% from 14% in the weeks before a software upgrade last September known as the Merge . That technological overhaul replaced Ethereum's at-the-time energy-intensive proof-of-work mechanism of verifying transactions with a proof-of-stake system and set the stage for Shanghai. Staking involves depositing coins in the blockchain to boost the network's security and verify transactions in return for rewards. Investor caution in pricing ether ahead of Shanghai stems from several factors, including concerns tokens unlocked after the upgrade will flood the market and regulatory issues. \"The Shanghai upgrade will unlock over 18 million ether staked since late 2020. The market is worried that the unlocking may bring about a sell-off, causing uncertainty in the market,\" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader at crypto asset-management firm Blofin, told CoinDesk. Bitcoin's share in the total crypto market continues to rise, while ether's stagnates. (TradingView) (TradingView) While the upgrade will unlock more than 18 million ETH, only partial withdrawals of 1.1 million ETH \u2013 the coins earned as staking rewards \u2013 will be withdrawable immediately. Analysts have recently said that the partial withdrawals will take several days to process and the resulting selling pressure is unlikely to be significant. \"If all partial withdrawals are attempted just after the Shapella fork (which seems highly improbable), it would take around four and a half days for these ETH profits to enter the market,\" Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, wrote in a note published Friday. According to Outumuro, full withdrawals representing most of the ETH staked will take longer. \"It would take approximately 100 days for one-third of validators to exit if they all attempt to exit simultaneously, translating into $80-$100M worth of ETH being withdrawn per day. This would make up about 1% of ETH\u2019s daily trading volume, though it is unlikely that all withdrawals will be sold,\" Outumuro noted. The market, however, isn't convinced, as evident from ether's underperformance relative to bitcoin and ether put options, or bearish bets, drawing higher prices than call options. Regulatory concerns are probably also weighing on investors. In February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Ethereum staking services offered by centralized exchanges amount to selling unregistered securities in the U.S. \"ETH faces relatively higher regulatory risks. The SEC has repeatedly stated that ETH is a security rather than a commodity, which differs from the CFTC's opinion and means additional risk, so investors understandably prefer BTC,\" Ardern said, referring to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. agency that regulates the futures market. Lastly, recent banking sector instability in the U.S. and the resulting sharp repricing of interest-rate expectations lower worldwide has benefited bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has evolved as a macro asset in the past three years and has a history of drawing safe-haven bids during banking crises. \"BTC got the store-of-value narrative back after multiple U.S. banks failed in mid-March. Since then, BTC's dominance rate has been rising,\" Dubai-based crypto analyst and trader Ritika Malik said. Dominance rate is now at a \"multiyear resistance\" that has capped the upside in the past, meaning ether and other coins could soon outshine bitcoin, Malik said. \"By being concerned, the market is actually 'pricing in' already any selling pressure that we are likely to get from the Shanghai hard fork and the upgrade could actually become a 'buy-the-news' event,\" she added. \"BTC dominance chart is at a multiyear resistance as well as we speak. All the stars are aligning for a rotation into ETH.\" Edited by Sheldon Reback.

                  "description": "The roots of an hour-long surge were difficult to pinpoint, according to one analyst, but investors have recently been more optimistic about the crypto\u2019s prospects following last month\u2019s banking crisis.",
                  "content": "James Rubin James Rubin is CoinDesk's U.S. news editor based on the West Coast. Follow @ @JPRubin23 on Twitter For a while Monday, even as large parts of the world were off work celebrating Easter Monday, bitcoin (BTC) seemed headed for a promised land above $30,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which just three weeks ago had teased a run toward this threshold, topped $29,744 in the afternoon, its highest level since early June, amid a surge in investor optimism. But the cause of the move was difficult to pinpoint. It was currently trading at $29,616. From about 10 a.m to 11 a.m. ET (14:00-15:00 UTC), bitcoin rose nearly 4%. It had been lingering closer to $28,000 since mid-March, when fears about the conventional banking system began to diminish. \u201cThere isn't a clear catalyst for this spike,\u201d Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk, although he said that the surge might stem partly from \u201cbuying from crypto traders voicing frustration on social media over a one-sided New York Times article that took issue over [bitcoin's] energy consumption.\u201d Moya also noted that the move higher \u201coccurred around the release of news that Federal Home Loan Bank debt issuance had lessened, signaling that \u201cthe banking crisis was easing.\u201d Ether (ETH) also jumped, crossing the $1,900 level before retreating. It was recently up about 1.7% versus 24 hours earlier. Other major cryptos were largely in the green, albeit light shades. ARB, the token of layer 2 blockchain Arbitrum, was recently up more than 2.8%, while XRP rose about 1%. The CoinDesk Market Index , a measure of the crypto market's overall performance, recently rose 2.3%. Equity indexes closed roughly flat with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rising a few ticks of a percentage point, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite losing 0.03%. Crypto-related stocks enjoyed a memorable day with crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and corporate bitcoin vault MicroStrategy (MSTR) both rising more than 7.5%. Markets will be eyeing the March Consumer Price March Index (CPI) report this week for signs that inflation is continuing its recent trudge downward. In February, inflation in the U.S. slowed to 0.4% from 0.5% a month earlier and 6% on a yearly basis from 6.4% the previous month. Bitcoin jumped past $26,000 following that report, on March 14. A continued slowdown could embolden central bankers to scale back their year-long regime of harsh interest rate hikes, although the impact on bitcoin is uncertain. The crypto seemed to gain momentum following the recent U.S. bank failures that caused worries about the conventional financial system, as investors shifted toward assets that retain value through good times and bad. Investors will also be weighing the first wave of quarterly earnings with banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup scheduled to report results. Analysts are expecting a largely downcast quarter, particularly in the hard-hit financial services sector. \u201cBTC is also being seen as a reliable store of value that lacks the issues that come with storing your money by way of a third-party intermediary, or a bank,\u201d Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO and chief legal officer of Banxa , a payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider to the crypto industry, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. \u201cThis is further supported by the decreasing correlation with the equity markets since 2021 \u2013 BTC is now properly starting to be perceived as a risk-off asset.\u201d Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, was cautiously optimistic about the sustainability of bitcoin\u2019s Monday surge. \u201cBitcoin is likely to find resistance at $30,000,\u201d DiPasquale noted in an email to CoinDesk. From a technical-analysis perspective, the current move is \u201ca retest of the range high established in March after the initial surge from under $20,000. Success of this test would see the price claiming $30,000 while a failure here should see BTC drop to $25,000, followed by $23,000.\u201d But he added: \u201cThe current price is also testing the lows of July 2021, where the market bounced back into another big rally.\u201d UPDATE (April 10, 2023, 22:27 UTC): Updates with bitcoin's most recent prices.

                  "content": "Omkar Godbole Omkar Godbole was a senior reporter on CoinDesk's Markets team. Follow @ godbole17 on Twitter Ethereum's highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade , also called the Shanghai-Capella hard fork, is set to occur Wednesday, after which users will have access to the $31 billion worth of ether ( ETH ) staked in the blockchain since December 2020. The upgrade has been widely hailed as long-term bullish for Ethereum's native token. Still, bitcoin ( BTC ), not ether, is outperforming the broader crypto market and becoming more dominant as the upgrade approaches. Bitcoin's dominance rate, which measures the largest cryptocurrency's share of crypto's total market valuation, rose to 48.5% early Tuesday, the highest since July 2021, according to data tracked by charting platform TradingView. The metric has risen by 15% this year. Ether's dominance rate remains stagnant between 19% and 20%. That compares with a rise to 21% from 14% in the weeks before a software upgrade last September known as the Merge . That technological overhaul replaced Ethereum's at-the-time energy-intensive proof-of-work mechanism of verifying transactions with a proof-of-stake system and set the stage for Shanghai. Staking involves depositing coins in the blockchain to boost the network's security and verify transactions in return for rewards. Investor caution in pricing ether ahead of Shanghai stems from several factors, including concerns tokens unlocked after the upgrade will flood the market and regulatory issues. \"The Shanghai upgrade will unlock over 18 million ether staked since late 2020. The market is worried that the unlocking may bring about a sell-off, causing uncertainty in the market,\" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader at crypto asset-management firm Blofin, told CoinDesk. Bitcoin's share in the total crypto market continues to rise, while ether's stagnates. (TradingView) (TradingView) While the upgrade will unlock more than 18 million ETH, only partial withdrawals of 1.1 million ETH \u2013 the coins earned as staking rewards \u2013 will be withdrawable immediately. Analysts have recently said that the partial withdrawals will take several days to process and the resulting selling pressure is unlikely to be significant. \"If all partial withdrawals are attempted just after the Shapella fork (which seems highly improbable), it would take around four and a half days for these ETH profits to enter the market,\" Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, wrote in a note published Friday. According to Outumuro, full withdrawals representing most of the ETH staked will take longer. \"It would take approximately 100 days for one-third of validators to exit if they all attempt to exit simultaneously, translating into $80-$100M worth of ETH being withdrawn per day. This would make up about 1% of ETH\u2019s daily trading volume, though it is unlikely that all withdrawals will be sold,\" Outumuro noted. The market, however, isn't convinced, as evident from ether's underperformance relative to bitcoin and ether put options, or bearish bets, drawing higher prices than call options. Regulatory concerns are probably also weighing on investors. In February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Ethereum staking services offered by centralized exchanges amount to selling unregistered securities in the U.S. \"ETH faces relatively higher regulatory risks. The SEC has repeatedly stated that ETH is a security rather than a commodity, which differs from the CFTC's opinion and means additional risk, so investors understandably prefer BTC,\" Ardern said, referring to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. agency that regulates the futures market. Lastly, recent banking sector instability in the U.S. and the resulting sharp repricing of interest-rate expectations lower worldwide has benefited bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has evolved as a macro asset in the past three years and has a history of drawing safe-haven bids during banking crises. \"BTC got the store-of-value narrative back after multiple U.S. banks failed in mid-March. Since then, BTC's dominance rate has been rising,\" Dubai-based crypto analyst and trader Ritika Malik said. Dominance rate is now at a \"multiyear resistance\" that has capped the upside in the past, meaning ether and other coins could soon outshine bitcoin, Malik said. \"By being concerned, the market is actually 'pricing in' already any selling pressure that we are likely to get from the Shanghai hard fork and the upgrade could actually become a 'buy-the-news' event,\" she added. \"BTC dominance chart is at a multiyear resistance as well as we speak. All the stars are aligning for a rotation into ETH.\" Edited by Sheldon Reback.

                  "description": "The roots of an hour-long surge were difficult to pinpoint, according to one analyst, but investors have recently been more optimistic about the crypto\u2019s prospects following last month\u2019s banking crisis.",
                  "content": "James Rubin James Rubin is CoinDesk's U.S. news editor based on the West Coast. Follow @ @JPRubin23 on Twitter For a while Monday, even as large parts of the world were off work celebrating Easter Monday, bitcoin (BTC) seemed headed for a promised land above $30,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which just three weeks ago had teased a run toward this threshold, topped $29,744 in the afternoon, its highest level since early June, amid a surge in investor optimism. But the cause of the move was difficult to pinpoint. It was currently trading at $29,616. From about 10 a.m to 11 a.m. ET (14:00-15:00 UTC), bitcoin rose nearly 4%. It had been lingering closer to $28,000 since mid-March, when fears about the conventional banking system began to diminish. \u201cThere isn't a clear catalyst for this spike,\u201d Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk, although he said that the surge might stem partly from \u201cbuying from crypto traders voicing frustration on social media over a one-sided New York Times article that took issue over [bitcoin's] energy consumption.\u201d Moya also noted that the move higher \u201coccurred around the release of news that Federal Home Loan Bank debt issuance had lessened, signaling that \u201cthe banking crisis was easing.\u201d Ether (ETH) also jumped, crossing the $1,900 level before retreating. It was recently up about 1.7% versus 24 hours earlier. Other major cryptos were largely in the green, albeit light shades. ARB, the token of layer 2 blockchain Arbitrum, was recently up more than 2.8%, while XRP rose about 1%. The CoinDesk Market Index , a measure of the crypto market's overall performance, recently rose 2.3%. Equity indexes closed roughly flat with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rising a few ticks of a percentage point, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite losing 0.03%. Crypto-related stocks enjoyed a memorable day with crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and corporate bitcoin vault MicroStrategy (MSTR) both rising more than 7.5%. Markets will be eyeing the March Consumer Price March Index (CPI) report this week for signs that inflation is continuing its recent trudge downward. In February, inflation in the U.S. slowed to 0.4% from 0.5% a month earlier and 6% on a yearly basis from 6.4% the previous month. Bitcoin jumped past $26,000 following that report, on March 14. A continued slowdown could embolden central bankers to scale back their year-long regime of harsh interest rate hikes, although the impact on bitcoin is uncertain. The crypto seemed to gain momentum following the recent U.S. bank failures that caused worries about the conventional financial system, as investors shifted toward assets that retain value through good times and bad. Investors will also be weighing the first wave of quarterly earnings with banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup scheduled to report results. Analysts are expecting a largely downcast quarter, particularly in the hard-hit financial services sector. \u201cBTC is also being seen as a reliable store of value that lacks the issues that come with storing your money by way of a third-party intermediary, or a bank,\u201d Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO and chief legal officer of Banxa , a payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider to the crypto industry, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. \u201cThis is further supported by the decreasing correlation with the equity markets since 2021 \u2013 BTC is now properly starting to be perceived as a risk-off asset.\u201d Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, was cautiously optimistic about the sustainability of bitcoin\u2019s Monday surge. \u201cBitcoin is likely to find resistance at $30,000,\u201d DiPasquale noted in an email to CoinDesk. From a technical-analysis perspective, the current move is \u201ca retest of the range high established in March after the initial surge from under $20,000. Success of this test would see the price claiming $30,000 while a failure here should see BTC drop to $25,000, followed by $23,000.\u201d But he added: \u201cThe current price is also testing the lows of July 2021, where the market bounced back into another big rally.\u201d UPDATE (April 10, 2023, 22:27 UTC): Updates with bitcoin's most recent prices.

                  "content": "Omkar Godbole Omkar Godbole was a senior reporter on CoinDesk's Markets team. Follow @ godbole17 on Twitter Ethereum's highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade , also called the Shanghai-Capella hard fork, is set to occur Wednesday, after which users will have access to the $31 billion worth of ether ( ETH ) staked in the blockchain since December 2020. The upgrade has been widely hailed as long-term bullish for Ethereum's native token. Still, bitcoin ( BTC ), not ether, is outperforming the broader crypto market and becoming more dominant as the upgrade approaches. Bitcoin's dominance rate, which measures the largest cryptocurrency's share of crypto's total market valuation, rose to 48.5% early Tuesday, the highest since July 2021, according to data tracked by charting platform TradingView. The metric has risen by 15% this year. Ether's dominance rate remains stagnant between 19% and 20%. That compares with a rise to 21% from 14% in the weeks before a software upgrade last September known as the Merge . That technological overhaul replaced Ethereum's at-the-time energy-intensive proof-of-work mechanism of verifying transactions with a proof-of-stake system and set the stage for Shanghai. Staking involves depositing coins in the blockchain to boost the network's security and verify transactions in return for rewards. Investor caution in pricing ether ahead of Shanghai stems from several factors, including concerns tokens unlocked after the upgrade will flood the market and regulatory issues. \"The Shanghai upgrade will unlock over 18 million ether staked since late 2020. The market is worried that the unlocking may bring about a sell-off, causing uncertainty in the market,\" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader at crypto asset-management firm Blofin, told CoinDesk. Bitcoin's share in the total crypto market continues to rise, while ether's stagnates. (TradingView) (TradingView) While the upgrade will unlock more than 18 million ETH, only partial withdrawals of 1.1 million ETH \u2013 the coins earned as staking rewards \u2013 will be withdrawable immediately. Analysts have recently said that the partial withdrawals will take several days to process and the resulting selling pressure is unlikely to be significant. \"If all partial withdrawals are attempted just after the Shapella fork (which seems highly improbable), it would take around four and a half days for these ETH profits to enter the market,\" Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, wrote in a note published Friday. According to Outumuro, full withdrawals representing most of the ETH staked will take longer. \"It would take approximately 100 days for one-third of validators to exit if they all attempt to exit simultaneously, translating into $80-$100M worth of ETH being withdrawn per day. This would make up about 1% of ETH\u2019s daily trading volume, though it is unlikely that all withdrawals will be sold,\" Outumuro noted. The market, however, isn't convinced, as evident from ether's underperformance relative to bitcoin and ether put options, or bearish bets, drawing higher prices than call options. Regulatory concerns are probably also weighing on investors. In February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Ethereum staking services offered by centralized exchanges amount to selling unregistered securities in the U.S. \"ETH faces relatively higher regulatory risks. The SEC has repeatedly stated that ETH is a security rather than a commodity, which differs from the CFTC's opinion and means additional risk, so investors understandably prefer BTC,\" Ardern said, referring to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. agency that regulates the futures market. Lastly, recent banking sector instability in the U.S. and the resulting sharp repricing of interest-rate expectations lower worldwide has benefited bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has evolved as a macro asset in the past three years and has a history of drawing safe-haven bids during banking crises. \"BTC got the store-of-value narrative back after multiple U.S. banks failed in mid-March. Since then, BTC's dominance rate has been rising,\" Dubai-based crypto analyst and trader Ritika Malik said. Dominance rate is now at a \"multiyear resistance\" that has capped the upside in the past, meaning ether and other coins could soon outshine bitcoin, Malik said. \"By being concerned, the market is actually 'pricing in' already any selling pressure that we are likely to get from the Shanghai hard fork and the upgrade could actually become a 'buy-the-news' event,\" she added. \"BTC dominance chart is at a multiyear resistance as well as we speak. All the stars are aligning for a rotation into ETH.\" Edited by Sheldon Reback.

                  "content": "James Rubin James Rubin is CoinDesk's U.S. news editor based on the West Coast. Follow @ @JPRubin23 on Twitter For a while Monday, even as large parts of the world were off work celebrating Easter Monday, bitcoin (BTC) seemed headed for a promised land above $30,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which just three weeks ago had teased a run toward this threshold, topped $29,744 in the afternoon, its highest level since early June, amid a surge in investor optimism. But the cause of the move was difficult to pinpoint. It was currently trading at $29,616. From about 10 a.m to 11 a.m. ET (14:00-15:00 UTC), bitcoin rose nearly 4%. It had been lingering closer to $28,000 since mid-March, when fears about the conventional banking system began to diminish. \u201cThere isn't a clear catalyst for this spike,\u201d Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk, although he said that the surge might stem partly from \u201cbuying from crypto traders voicing frustration on social media over a one-sided New York Times article that took issue over [bitcoin's] energy consumption.\u201d Moya also noted that the move higher \u201coccurred around the release of news that Federal Home Loan Bank debt issuance had lessened, signaling that \u201cthe banking crisis was easing.\u201d Ether (ETH) also jumped, crossing the $1,900 level before retreating. It was recently up about 1.7% versus 24 hours earlier. Other major cryptos were largely in the green, albeit light shades. ARB, the token of layer 2 blockchain Arbitrum, was recently up more than 2.8%, while XRP rose about 1%. The CoinDesk Market Index , a measure of the crypto market's overall performance, recently rose 2.3%. Equity indexes closed roughly flat with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rising a few ticks of a percentage point, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite losing 0.03%. Crypto-related stocks enjoyed a memorable day with crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and corporate bitcoin vault MicroStrategy (MSTR) both rising more than 7.5%. Markets will be eyeing the March Consumer Price March Index (CPI) report this week for signs that inflation is continuing its recent trudge downward. In February, inflation in the U.S. slowed to 0.4% from 0.5% a month earlier and 6% on a yearly basis from 6.4% the previous month. Bitcoin jumped past $26,000 following that report, on March 14. A continued slowdown could embolden central bankers to scale back their year-long regime of harsh interest rate hikes, although the impact on bitcoin is uncertain. The crypto seemed to gain momentum following the recent U.S. bank failures that caused worries about the conventional financial system, as investors shifted toward assets that retain value through good times and bad. Investors will also be weighing the first wave of quarterly earnings with banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup scheduled to report results. Analysts are expecting a largely downcast quarter, particularly in the hard-hit financial services sector. \u201cBTC is also being seen as a reliable store of value that lacks the issues that come with storing your money by way of a third-party intermediary, or a bank,\u201d Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO and chief legal officer of Banxa , a payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider to the crypto industry, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. \u201cThis is further supported by the decreasing correlation with the equity markets since 2021 \u2013 BTC is now properly starting to be perceived as a risk-off asset.\u201d Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, was cautiously optimistic about the sustainability of bitcoin\u2019s Monday surge. \u201cBitcoin is likely to find resistance at $30,000,\u201d DiPasquale noted in an email to CoinDesk. From a technical-analysis perspective, the current move is \u201ca retest of the range high established in March after the initial surge from under $20,000. Success of this test would see the price claiming $30,000 while a failure here should see BTC drop to $25,000, followed by $23,000.\u201d But he added: \u201cThe current price is also testing the lows of July 2021, where the market bounced back into another big rally.\u201d UPDATE (April 10, 2023, 22:27 UTC): Updates with bitcoin's most recent prices.

                  "description": "Bitcoin's dominance rate, or share of the total crypto market, has risen to its highest in almost two years while ether's stagnates.",
                  "content": "Omkar Godbole Omkar Godbole was a senior reporter on CoinDesk's Markets team. Follow @ godbole17 on Twitter Ethereum's highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade , also called the Shanghai-Capella hard fork, is set to occur Wednesday, after which users will have access to the $31 billion worth of ether ( ETH ) staked in the blockchain since December 2020. The upgrade has been widely hailed as long-term bullish for Ethereum's native token. Still, bitcoin ( BTC ), not ether, is outperforming the broader crypto market and becoming more dominant as the upgrade approaches. Bitcoin's dominance rate, which measures the largest cryptocurrency's share of crypto's total market valuation, rose to 48.5% early Tuesday, the highest since July 2021, according to data tracked by charting platform TradingView. The metric has risen by 15% this year. Ether's dominance rate remains stagnant between 19% and 20%. That compares with a rise to 21% from 14% in the weeks before a software upgrade last September known as the Merge . That technological overhaul replaced Ethereum's at-the-time energy-intensive proof-of-work mechanism of verifying transactions with a proof-of-stake system and set the stage for Shanghai. Staking involves depositing coins in the blockchain to boost the network's security and verify transactions in return for rewards. Investor caution in pricing ether ahead of Shanghai stems from several factors, including concerns tokens unlocked after the upgrade will flood the market and regulatory issues. \"The Shanghai upgrade will unlock over 18 million ether staked since late 2020. The market is worried that the unlocking may bring about a sell-off, causing uncertainty in the market,\" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader at crypto asset-management firm Blofin, told CoinDesk. Bitcoin's share in the total crypto market continues to rise, while ether's stagnates. (TradingView) (TradingView) While the upgrade will unlock more than 18 million ETH, only partial withdrawals of 1.1 million ETH \u2013 the coins earned as staking rewards \u2013 will be withdrawable immediately. Analysts have recently said that the partial withdrawals will take several days to process and the resulting selling pressure is unlikely to be significant. \"If all partial withdrawals are attempted just after the Shapella fork (which seems highly improbable), it would take around four and a half days for these ETH profits to enter the market,\" Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, wrote in a note published Friday. According to Outumuro, full withdrawals representing most of the ETH staked will take longer. \"It would take approximately 100 days for one-third of validators to exit if they all attempt to exit simultaneously, translating into $80-$100M worth of ETH being withdrawn per day. This would make up about 1% of ETH\u2019s daily trading volume, though it is unlikely that all withdrawals will be sold,\" Outumuro noted. The market, however, isn't convinced, as evident from ether's underperformance relative to bitcoin and ether put options, or bearish bets, drawing higher prices than call options. Regulatory concerns are probably also weighing on investors. In February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Ethereum staking services offered by centralized exchanges amount to selling unregistered securities in the U.S. \"ETH faces relatively higher regulatory risks. The SEC has repeatedly stated that ETH is a security rather than a commodity, which differs from the CFTC's opinion and means additional risk, so investors understandably prefer BTC,\" Ardern said, referring to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. agency that regulates the futures market. Lastly, recent banking sector instability in the U.S. and the resulting sharp repricing of interest-rate expectations lower worldwide has benefited bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has evolved as a macro asset in the past three years and has a history of drawing safe-haven bids during banking crises. \"BTC got the store-of-value narrative back after multiple U.S. banks failed in mid-March. Since then, BTC's dominance rate has been rising,\" Dubai-based crypto analyst and trader Ritika Malik said. Dominance rate is now at a \"multiyear resistance\" that has capped the upside in the past, meaning ether and other coins could soon outshine bitcoin, Malik said. \"By being concerned, the market is actually 'pricing in' already any selling pressure that we are likely to get from the Shanghai hard fork and the upgrade could actually become a 'buy-the-news' event,\" she added. \"BTC dominance chart is at a multiyear resistance as well as we speak. All the stars are aligning for a rotation into ETH.\" Edited by Sheldon Reback.

                  "content": "James Rubin James Rubin is CoinDesk's U.S. news editor based on the West Coast. Follow @ @JPRubin23 on Twitter For a while Monday, even as large parts of the world were off work celebrating Easter Monday, bitcoin (BTC) seemed headed for a promised land above $30,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which just three weeks ago had teased a run toward this threshold, topped $29,744 in the afternoon, its highest level since early June, amid a surge in investor optimism. But the cause of the move was difficult to pinpoint. It was currently trading at $29,616. From about 10 a.m to 11 a.m. ET (14:00-15:00 UTC), bitcoin rose nearly 4%. It had been lingering closer to $28,000 since mid-March, when fears about the conventional banking system began to diminish. \u201cThere isn't a clear catalyst for this spike,\u201d Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk, although he said that the surge might stem partly from \u201cbuying from crypto traders voicing frustration on social media over a one-sided New York Times article that took issue over [bitcoin's] energy consumption.\u201d Moya also noted that the move higher \u201coccurred around the release of news that Federal Home Loan Bank debt issuance had lessened, signaling that \u201cthe banking crisis was easing.\u201d Ether (ETH) also jumped, crossing the $1,900 level before retreating. It was recently up about 1.7% versus 24 hours earlier. Other major cryptos were largely in the green, albeit light shades. ARB, the token of layer 2 blockchain Arbitrum, was recently up more than 2.8%, while XRP rose about 1%. The CoinDesk Market Index , a measure of the crypto market's overall performance, recently rose 2.3%. Equity indexes closed roughly flat with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rising a few ticks of a percentage point, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite losing 0.03%. Crypto-related stocks enjoyed a memorable day with crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and corporate bitcoin vault MicroStrategy (MSTR) both rising more than 7.5%. Markets will be eyeing the March Consumer Price March Index (CPI) report this week for signs that inflation is continuing its recent trudge downward. In February, inflation in the U.S. slowed to 0.4% from 0.5% a month earlier and 6% on a yearly basis from 6.4% the previous month. Bitcoin jumped past $26,000 following that report, on March 14. A continued slowdown could embolden central bankers to scale back their year-long regime of harsh interest rate hikes, although the impact on bitcoin is uncertain. The crypto seemed to gain momentum following the recent U.S. bank failures that caused worries about the conventional financial system, as investors shifted toward assets that retain value through good times and bad. Investors will also be weighing the first wave of quarterly earnings with banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup scheduled to report results. Analysts are expecting a largely downcast quarter, particularly in the hard-hit financial services sector. \u201cBTC is also being seen as a reliable store of value that lacks the issues that come with storing your money by way of a third-party intermediary, or a bank,\u201d Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO and chief legal officer of Banxa , a payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider to the crypto industry, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. \u201cThis is further supported by the decreasing correlation with the equity markets since 2021 \u2013 BTC is now properly starting to be perceived as a risk-off asset.\u201d Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, was cautiously optimistic about the sustainability of bitcoin\u2019s Monday surge. \u201cBitcoin is likely to find resistance at $30,000,\u201d DiPasquale noted in an email to CoinDesk. From a technical-analysis perspective, the current move is \u201ca retest of the range high established in March after the initial surge from under $20,000. Success of this test would see the price claiming $30,000 while a failure here should see BTC drop to $25,000, followed by $23,000.\u201d But he added: \u201cThe current price is also testing the lows of July 2021, where the market bounced back into another big rally.\u201d UPDATE (April 10, 2023, 22:27 UTC): Updates with bitcoin's most recent prices.

                  "description": "Bitcoin's dominance rate, or share of the total crypto market, has risen to its highest in almost two years while ether's stagnates.",
                  "content": "Omkar Godbole Omkar Godbole was a senior reporter on CoinDesk's Markets team. Follow @ godbole17 on Twitter Ethereum's highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade , also called the Shanghai-Capella hard fork, is set to occur Wednesday, after which users will have access to the $31 billion worth of ether ( ETH ) staked in the blockchain since December 2020. The upgrade has been widely hailed as long-term bullish for Ethereum's native token. Still, bitcoin ( BTC ), not ether, is outperforming the broader crypto market and becoming more dominant as the upgrade approaches. Bitcoin's dominance rate, which measures the largest cryptocurrency's share of crypto's total market valuation, rose to 48.5% early Tuesday, the highest since July 2021, according to data tracked by charting platform TradingView. The metric has risen by 15% this year. Ether's dominance rate remains stagnant between 19% and 20%. That compares with a rise to 21% from 14% in the weeks before a software upgrade last September known as the Merge . That technological overhaul replaced Ethereum's at-the-time energy-intensive proof-of-work mechanism of verifying transactions with a proof-of-stake system and set the stage for Shanghai. Staking involves depositing coins in the blockchain to boost the network's security and verify transactions in return for rewards. Investor caution in pricing ether ahead of Shanghai stems from several factors, including concerns tokens unlocked after the upgrade will flood the market and regulatory issues. \"The Shanghai upgrade will unlock over 18 million ether staked since late 2020. The market is worried that the unlocking may bring about a sell-off, causing uncertainty in the market,\" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader at crypto asset-management firm Blofin, told CoinDesk. Bitcoin's share in the total crypto market continues to rise, while ether's stagnates. (TradingView) (TradingView) While the upgrade will unlock more than 18 million ETH, only partial withdrawals of 1.1 million ETH \u2013 the coins earned as staking rewards \u2013 will be withdrawable immediately. Analysts have recently said that the partial withdrawals will take several days to process and the resulting selling pressure is unlikely to be significant. \"If all partial withdrawals are attempted just after the Shapella fork (which seems highly improbable), it would take around four and a half days for these ETH profits to enter the market,\" Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, wrote in a note published Friday. According to Outumuro, full withdrawals representing most of the ETH staked will take longer. \"It would take approximately 100 days for one-third of validators to exit if they all attempt to exit simultaneously, translating into $80-$100M worth of ETH being withdrawn per day. This would make up about 1% of ETH\u2019s daily trading volume, though it is unlikely that all withdrawals will be sold,\" Outumuro noted. The market, however, isn't convinced, as evident from ether's underperformance relative to bitcoin and ether put options, or bearish bets, drawing higher prices than call options. Regulatory concerns are probably also weighing on investors. In February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Ethereum staking services offered by centralized exchanges amount to selling unregistered securities in the U.S. \"ETH faces relatively higher regulatory risks. The SEC has repeatedly stated that ETH is a security rather than a commodity, which differs from the CFTC's opinion and means additional risk, so investors understandably prefer BTC,\" Ardern said, referring to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. agency that regulates the futures market. Lastly, recent banking sector instability in the U.S. and the resulting sharp repricing of interest-rate expectations lower worldwide has benefited bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has evolved as a macro asset in the past three years and has a history of drawing safe-haven bids during banking crises. \"BTC got the store-of-value narrative back after multiple U.S. banks failed in mid-March. Since then, BTC's dominance rate has been rising,\" Dubai-based crypto analyst and trader Ritika Malik said. Dominance rate is now at a \"multiyear resistance\" that has capped the upside in the past, meaning ether and other coins could soon outshine bitcoin, Malik said. \"By being concerned, the market is actually 'pricing in' already any selling pressure that we are likely to get from the Shanghai hard fork and the upgrade could actually become a 'buy-the-news' event,\" she added. \"BTC dominance chart is at a multiyear resistance as well as we speak. All the stars are aligning for a rotation into ETH.\" Edited by Sheldon Reback.

                  "description": "The roots of an hour-long surge were difficult to pinpoint, according to one analyst, but investors have recently been more optimistic about the crypto\u2019s prospects following last month\u2019s banking crisis.",
                  "content": "James Rubin James Rubin is CoinDesk's U.S. news editor based on the West Coast. Follow @ @JPRubin23 on Twitter For a while Monday, even as large parts of the world were off work celebrating Easter Monday, bitcoin (BTC) seemed headed for a promised land above $30,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which just three weeks ago had teased a run toward this threshold, topped $29,744 in the afternoon, its highest level since early June, amid a surge in investor optimism. But the cause of the move was difficult to pinpoint. It was currently trading at $29,616. From about 10 a.m to 11 a.m. ET (14:00-15:00 UTC), bitcoin rose nearly 4%. It had been lingering closer to $28,000 since mid-March, when fears about the conventional banking system began to diminish. \u201cThere isn't a clear catalyst for this spike,\u201d Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk, although he said that the surge might stem partly from \u201cbuying from crypto traders voicing frustration on social media over a one-sided New York Times article that took issue over [bitcoin's] energy consumption.\u201d Moya also noted that the move higher \u201coccurred around the release of news that Federal Home Loan Bank debt issuance had lessened, signaling that \u201cthe banking crisis was easing.\u201d Ether (ETH) also jumped, crossing the $1,900 level before retreating. It was recently up about 1.7% versus 24 hours earlier. Other major cryptos were largely in the green, albeit light shades. ARB, the token of layer 2 blockchain Arbitrum, was recently up more than 2.8%, while XRP rose about 1%. The CoinDesk Market Index , a measure of the crypto market's overall performance, recently rose 2.3%. Equity indexes closed roughly flat with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rising a few ticks of a percentage point, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite losing 0.03%. Crypto-related stocks enjoyed a memorable day with crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and corporate bitcoin vault MicroStrategy (MSTR) both rising more than 7.5%. Markets will be eyeing the March Consumer Price March Index (CPI) report this week for signs that inflation is continuing its recent trudge downward. In February, inflation in the U.S. slowed to 0.4% from 0.5% a month earlier and 6% on a yearly basis from 6.4% the previous month. Bitcoin jumped past $26,000 following that report, on March 14. A continued slowdown could embolden central bankers to scale back their year-long regime of harsh interest rate hikes, although the impact on bitcoin is uncertain. The crypto seemed to gain momentum following the recent U.S. bank failures that caused worries about the conventional financial system, as investors shifted toward assets that retain value through good times and bad. Investors will also be weighing the first wave of quarterly earnings with banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup scheduled to report results. Analysts are expecting a largely downcast quarter, particularly in the hard-hit financial services sector. \u201cBTC is also being seen as a reliable store of value that lacks the issues that come with storing your money by way of a third-party intermediary, or a bank,\u201d Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO and chief legal officer of Banxa , a payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider to the crypto industry, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. \u201cThis is further supported by the decreasing correlation with the equity markets since 2021 \u2013 BTC is now properly starting to be perceived as a risk-off asset.\u201d Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, was cautiously optimistic about the sustainability of bitcoin\u2019s Monday surge. \u201cBitcoin is likely to find resistance at $30,000,\u201d DiPasquale noted in an email to CoinDesk. From a technical-analysis perspective, the current move is \u201ca retest of the range high established in March after the initial surge from under $20,000. Success of this test would see the price claiming $30,000 while a failure here should see BTC drop to $25,000, followed by $23,000.\u201d But he added: \u201cThe current price is also testing the lows of July 2021, where the market bounced back into another big rally.\u201d UPDATE (April 10, 2023, 22:27 UTC): Updates with bitcoin's most recent prices.

Bitcoin's dominance rate, which measures the largest cryptocurrency's share of crypto's total market valuation, rose to 48.5% early Tuesday, the highest since July 2021, according to data tracked by charting platform TradingView. The metric has risen by 15% this year. Ether's dominance rate remains stagnant between 19% and 20%. That compares with a rise to 21% from 14% in the weeks before a software upgrade last September known as the Merge . That technological overhaul replaced Ethereum's at-the-time energy-intensive proof-of-work mechanism of verifying transactions with a proof-of-stake system and set the stage for Shanghai. Staking involves depositing coins in the blockchain to boost the network's security and verify transactions in return for rewards. Investor caution in pricing ether ahead of Shanghai stems from several factors, including concerns tokens unlocked after the upgrade will flood the market and regulatory issues. \"The Shanghai upgrade will unlock over 18 million ether staked since late 2020. The market is worried that the unlocking may bring about a sell-off, causing uncertainty in the market,\" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader at crypto asset-management firm Blofin, told CoinDesk. Bitcoin's share in the total crypto market continues to rise, while ether's stagnates. (TradingView) (TradingView) While the upgrade will unlock more than 18 million ETH, only partial withdrawals of 1.1 million ETH \u2013 the coins earned as staking rewards \u2013 will be withdrawable immediately. Analysts have recently said that the partial withdrawals will take several days to process and the resulting selling pressure is unlikely to be significant. \"If all partial withdrawals are attempted just after the Shapella fork (which seems highly improbable), it would take around four and a half days for these ETH profits to enter the market,\" Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, wrote in a note published Friday. According to Outumuro, full withdrawals representing most of the ETH staked will take longer. \"It would take approximately 100 days for one-third of validators to exit if they all attempt to exit simultaneously, translating into $80-$100M worth of ETH being withdrawn per day. This would make up about 1% of ETH\u2019s daily trading volume, though it is unlikely that all withdrawals will be sold,\" Outumuro noted. The market, however, isn't convinced, as evident from ether's underperformance relative to bitcoin and ether put options, or bearish bets, drawing higher prices than call options. Regulatory concerns are probably also weighing on investors. In February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Ethereum staking services offered by centralized exchanges amount to selling unregistered securities in the U.S. \"ETH faces relatively higher regulatory risks. The SEC has repeatedly stated that ETH is a security rather than a commodity, which differs from the CFTC's opinion and means additional risk, so investors understandably prefer BTC,\" Ardern said, referring to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. agency that regulates the futures market. Lastly, recent banking sector instability in the U.S. and the resulting sharp repricing of interest-rate expectations lower worldwide has benefited bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has evolved as a macro asset in the past three years and has a history of drawing safe-haven bids during banking crises. \"BTC got the store-of-value narrative back after multiple U.S. banks failed in mid-March. Since then, BTC's dominance rate has been rising,\" Dubai-based crypto analyst and trader Ritika Malik said. Dominance rate is now at a \"multiyear resistance\" that has capped the upside in the past, meaning ether and other coins could soon outshine bitcoin, Malik said. \"By being concerned, the market is actually 'pricing in' already any selling pressure that we are likely to get from the Shanghai hard fork and the upgrade could actually become a 'buy-the-news' event,\" she added. \"BTC dominance chart is at a multiyear resistance as well as we speak. All the stars are aligning for a rotation into ETH.\" Edited by Sheldon Reback.

                  "description": "The roots of an hour-long surge were difficult to pinpoint, according to one analyst, but investors have recently been more optimistic about the crypto\u2019s prospects following last month\u2019s banking crisis.",
                  "content": "James Rubin James Rubin is CoinDesk's U.S. news editor based on the West Coast. Follow @ @JPRubin23 on Twitter For a while Monday, even as large parts of the world were off work celebrating Easter Monday, bitcoin (BTC) seemed headed for a promised land above $30,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which just three weeks ago had teased a run toward this threshold, topped $29,744 in the afternoon, its highest level since early June, amid a surge in investor optimism. But the cause of the move was difficult to pinpoint. It was currently trading at $29,616. From about 10 a.m to 11 a.m. ET (14:00-15:00 UTC), bitcoin rose nearly 4%. It had been lingering closer to $28,000 since mid-March, when fears about the conventional banking system began to diminish. \u201cThere isn't a clear catalyst for this spike,\u201d Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk, although he said that the surge might stem partly from \u201cbuying from crypto traders voicing frustration on social media over a one-sided New York Times article that took issue over [bitcoin's] energy consumption.\u201d Moya also noted that the move higher \u201coccurred around the release of news that Federal Home Loan Bank debt issuance had lessened, signaling that \u201cthe banking crisis was easing.\u201d Ether (ETH) also jumped, crossing the $1,900 level before retreating. It was recently up about 1.7% versus 24 hours earlier. Other major cryptos were largely in the green, albeit light shades. ARB, the token of layer 2 blockchain Arbitrum, was recently up more than 2.8%, while XRP rose about 1%. The CoinDesk Market Index , a measure of the crypto market's overall performance, recently rose 2.3%. Equity indexes closed roughly flat with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rising a few ticks of a percentage point, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite losing 0.03%. Crypto-related stocks enjoyed a memorable day with crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and corporate bitcoin vault MicroStrategy (MSTR) both rising more than 7.5%. Markets will be eyeing the March Consumer Price March Index (CPI) report this week for signs that inflation is continuing its recent trudge downward. In February, inflation in the U.S. slowed to 0.4% from 0.5% a month earlier and 6% on a yearly basis from 6.4% the previous month. Bitcoin jumped past $26,000 following that report, on March 14. A continued slowdown could embolden central bankers to scale back their year-long regime of harsh interest rate hikes, although the impact on bitcoin is uncertain. The crypto seemed to gain momentum following the recent U.S. bank failures that caused worries about the conventional financial system, as investors shifted toward assets that retain value through good times and bad. Investors will also be weighing the first wave of quarterly earnings with banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup scheduled to report results. Analysts are expecting a largely downcast quarter, particularly in the hard-hit financial services sector. \u201cBTC is also being seen as a reliable store of value that lacks the issues that come with storing your money by way of a third-party intermediary, or a bank,\u201d Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO and chief legal officer of Banxa , a payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider to the crypto industry, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. \u201cThis is further supported by the decreasing correlation with the equity markets since 2021 \u2013 BTC is now properly starting to be perceived as a risk-off asset.\u201d Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, was cautiously optimistic about the sustainability of bitcoin\u2019s Monday surge. \u201cBitcoin is likely to find resistance at $30,000,\u201d DiPasquale noted in an email to CoinDesk. From a technical-analysis perspective, the current move is \u201ca retest of the range high established in March after the initial surge from under $20,000. Success of this test would see the price claiming $30,000 while a failure here should see BTC drop to $25,000, followed by $23,000.\u201d But he added: \u201cThe current price is also testing the lows of July 2021, where the market bounced back into another big rally.\u201d UPDATE (April 10, 2023, 22:27 UTC): Updates with bitcoin's most recent prices.

                  "description": "Bitcoin's dominance rate, or share of the total crypto market, has risen to its highest in almost two years while ether's stagnates.",
                  "content": "Omkar Godbole Omkar Godbole was a senior reporter on CoinDesk's Markets team. Follow @ godbole17 on Twitter Ethereum's highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade , also called the Shanghai-Capella hard fork, is set to occur Wednesday, after which users will have access to the $31 billion worth of ether ( ETH ) staked in the blockchain since December 2020. The upgrade has been widely hailed as long-term bullish for Ethereum's native token. Still, bitcoin ( BTC ), not ether, is outperforming the broader crypto market and becoming more dominant as the upgrade approaches. Bitcoin's dominance rate, which measures the largest cryptocurrency's share of crypto's total market valuation, rose to 48.5% early Tuesday, the highest since July 2021, according to data tracked by charting platform TradingView. The metric has risen by 15% this year. Ether's dominance rate remains stagnant between 19% and 20%. That compares with a rise to 21% from 14% in the weeks before a software upgrade last September known as the Merge . That technological overhaul replaced Ethereum's at-the-time energy-intensive proof-of-work mechanism of verifying transactions with a proof-of-stake system and set the stage for Shanghai. Staking involves depositing coins in the blockchain to boost the network's security and verify transactions in return for rewards. Investor caution in pricing ether ahead of Shanghai stems from several factors, including concerns tokens unlocked after the upgrade will flood the market and regulatory issues. \"The Shanghai upgrade will unlock over 18 million ether staked since late 2020. The market is worried that the unlocking may bring about a sell-off, causing uncertainty in the market,\" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader at crypto asset-management firm Blofin, told CoinDesk. Bitcoin's share in the total crypto market continues to rise, while ether's stagnates. (TradingView) (TradingView) While the upgrade will unlock more than 18 million ETH, only partial withdrawals of 1.1 million ETH \u2013 the coins earned as staking rewards \u2013 will be withdrawable immediately. Analysts have recently said that the partial withdrawals will take several days to process and the resulting selling pressure is unlikely to be significant. \"If all partial withdrawals are attempted just after the Shapella fork (which seems highly improbable), it would take around four and a half days for these ETH profits to enter the market,\" Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, wrote in a note published Friday. According to Outumuro, full withdrawals representing most of the ETH staked will take longer. \"It would take approximately 100 days for one-third of validators to exit if they all attempt to exit simultaneously, translating into $80-$100M worth of ETH being withdrawn per day. This would make up about 1% of ETH\u2019s daily trading volume, though it is unlikely that all withdrawals will be sold,\" Outumuro noted. The market, however, isn't convinced, as evident from ether's underperformance relative to bitcoin and ether put options, or bearish bets, drawing higher prices than call options. Regulatory concerns are probably also weighing on investors. In February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Ethereum staking services offered by centralized exchanges amount to selling unregistered securities in the U.S. \"ETH faces relatively higher regulatory risks. The SEC has repeatedly stated that ETH is a security rather than a commodity, which differs from the CFTC's opinion and means additional risk, so investors understandably prefer BTC,\" Ardern said, referring to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. agency that regulates the futures market. Lastly, recent banking sector instability in the U.S. and the resulting sharp repricing of interest-rate expectations lower worldwide has benefited bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has evolved as a macro asset in the past three years and has a history of drawing safe-haven bids during banking crises. \"BTC got the store-of-value narrative back after multiple U.S. banks failed in mid-March. Since then, BTC's dominance rate has been rising,\" Dubai-based crypto analyst and trader Ritika Malik said. Dominance rate is now at a \"multiyear resistance\" that has capped the upside in the past, meaning ether and other coins could soon outshine bitcoin, Malik said. \"By being concerned, the market is actually 'pricing in' already any selling pressure that we are likely to get from the Shanghai hard fork and the upgrade could actually become a 'buy-the-news' event,\" she added. \"BTC dominance chart is at a multiyear resistance as well as we speak. All the stars are aligning for a rotation into ETH.\" Edited by Sheldon Reback.

                  "content": "God save our gracious coin, and long live the coin. A team of entrepreneurs, environmentalists and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have assembled to back Bitcoin in Britain. Bitcoin Policy UK (BPUK) unites stakeholders, policymakers, environmentalists, tax specialists, Bitcoin experts and miners to \u201cunlock the potential of Bitcoin\u201d in Britain and explore how the decentralized currency\u2019s burgeoning industry could benefit U.K. households, businesses and communities. BPUK\u2019s primary objectives are to drive investment, generate and prepare students for the Bitcoin jobs of the future, raise awareness and education, and explore the use of wasted and stranded energy resources for Bitcoin mining. Freddie New, BPUK\u2019s head of policy, told Cointelegraph that \u201cthe genesis of this project was the Bitcoin Collective Conference in Edinburgh\u201d \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s largest Bitcoin conference, taking place in fall 2022 . New told Cointelegraph that most of the team had been working on Bitcoin advocacy in one way or another before the conference, \u201cbut coming together like this will enable us to formalize these efforts and focus on three key related areas.\u201d He continued: Some of the advisers and board members are familiar to Cointelegraph readers. Author and journalist DecentraSuze, whose son recently introduced Bitcoin to the classroom , is a director, while Jordan Walker, co-founder of The Bitcoin Collective , and Mark Morton are advisers. Morton\u2019s Bitcoin mining company, Scilling Digital Mining, was featured in a recent Cointelegraph mini-documentary: Walker told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is an important piece of the collective puzzle to drive Bitcoin education in the U.K.: New told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is not-for-profit. To operate, it hopes to raise funds through the community, tapping into the growing trend of funding projects with satoshis , or small amounts of BTC, via the Lightning Network, a layer-2 instant payment solution built atop Bitcoin. Part of the team\u2019s mission is to locate and harness renewable, wasted or stranded energy across the U.K., New explained. He continued with the plan: \u201cWe can then invite British policymakers to these sites so they can see mines in action and hopefully understand more about the industry\u2019s potential to mitigate vented methane, provide demand response for renewable grids, or simply act as a customer for energy that is otherwise wasted.\u201d The U.K. has burgeoning renewable energy sources but lacks in hash rate (a measure of the Bitcoin protocol\u2019s security). According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the U.K. supports 0.23% of the global monthly hash rate, compared with the United States\u2019 37.84%. This is partly due to electricity costs in the U.K. exceeding those of the U.S. and Asia, but also due to Bitcoin mining awareness \u2014 or a lack thereof \u2014 in the U.K. Moreover, legacy media platforms have taken aim at the Bitcoin mining industry in recent years \u2014 the Guardian critiqued Bitcoin as \u201cdigital beef\u201d instead of \u201cdigital gold.\u201d BPUK highlighted that in light of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union, it could develop a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency regime separate from that of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in Europe. The European parliamentary committee on MiCA may threaten Bitcoin mining on the continent . BPUK co-founder Krista Edmunds took inspiration from El Salvador\u2019s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Edmunds explained: On the governmental side, the policy group will have an opportunity to educate and inform. Lisa Cameron, a member of Parliament and chairperson of the Crypto and Digital Assets All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), told Cointelegraph in an interview last year: \u201cWe are on a learning curve, and it\u2019s just very, very important because the U.K. government has a policy vision that the U.K. will become an international hub of cryptocurrency and digital assets.\u201d She added that there was some confusion surrounding Bitcoin, central bank digital currencies and cryptocurrency. New explained that as a Bitcoin-only organization, the BPUK ultimately seeks to \u201cmake sure that Bitcoin is included in the government\u2019s proposals, if not at the front and center.\"",

                  "description": "In what Palestine defenders and even one mainstream U.S. Jewish group called a perilous provocation, leaders of Israel's far-right government accompanied thousands of settlers shielded by a heavy military presence on a Monday march to an illegal colony in the occupied West Bank.Senior officials in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right Cabinet\u2014including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich\u2014and numerous right-wing lawmakers joined a crowd of as many as 20,000 pro-apartheid demonstrators who marched to Evyatar in a bid to legitimize the outpost, The Times of Israel reports.According to Haaretz, 22 Palestinians including residents of the nearby town of Beita were wounded when Israeli occupation forces fired on them with less-lethal weapons including rubber-tipped steel bullets during and after the march. More than 100 people including journalists also suffered from inhaling gas used by Israeli forces to disperse counter-demonstrators. At least two journalists were hospitalized as a result of their injuries. Meanwhile, marchers brought inflatable bouncy houses and other amusements to entertain children during the demonstration. \\u201cThousands of Israeli settlers marched through the northern West Bank today towards the Palestinian village of Beita flanked by Israeli regime forces. \\n\\nAmong them were dozens of Israeli regime ministers & lawmakers. \\n\\nMeanwhile Palestinians were tear gassed & their roads closed.\\u201d \u2014 Dr. Yara Hawari \\u062f. \\u064a\\u0627\\u0631\\u0627 \\u0647\\u0648\\u0627\\u0631\\u064a (@Dr. Yara Hawari \\u062f. \\u064a\\u0627\\u0631\\u0627 \\u0647\\u0648\\u0627\\u0631\\u064a) 1681137061 The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the march as \"a dangerous escalation and provocation of the Palestinian people and an extension of the incitement calls of the Israeli right and the fascist right to deepen settlement at the expense of land.\" Yumna Patel, Palestine news director at Mondoweiss, said on Twitter: \"The cognitive dissonance is truly astounding. Israeli settlers march on stolen land, in a settler colony that's given them the land to steal and colonize, alongside an army whose singular goal is to protect them. And yet, somehow, they are the victims in their own narrative.\"The liberal U.S. Jewish group J Street also condemned the march, tweeting that \"this is an incendiary and deeply dangerous act by some of the most senior ministers in the Israeli government.\"\"Their vision is clear: annexation, endless conflict, and chaos,\" the group added. \\u201cFar-right Israeli ministers join settler march for illegal Evyatar outpost\\n\\nIsraeli settlers marched near Nablus in the occupied West Bank to demand the re-establishment and legalisation of the evacuated illegal outpost of Evyatar (Avitar) near the Palestinian town of Beita\\u201d \u2014 Middle East Monitor (@Middle East Monitor) 1681207188 However, Ben-Gvir\u2014who is a settler\u2014asserted that \"we are here, and we are marching toward the future... I hope the entire state of Israel understands this.\"Smotrich told Haaretz while marching that \"God willing, we'll bring here another half-million Jews on top the half-million that are already here.\" United Nations experts say the true number of Israeli settlers colonizing the West Bank and East Jerusalem is closer to 700,000.Evyatar, an exclusively Jewish community first established in 2013, is built on stolen Palestinian land on Mount Sabih in Beita, south of Nablus. The settlement is illegal under both international and Israeli law and has been repeatedly destroyed by Israeli authorities. Since 1967, at least 77 Beita residents have been killed by Israeli forces, many of them during protests, according to Patel. \\u201cThe Palestinians in Beit have been protesting against the Evyatar outpost since 2021. At least 7 people, including 2 children, from the town have been killed over the course of the protests. We covered Beita's fight against the outpost back in 2021 https://t.co/Nw4aLS7LzD\\u201d \u2014 Yumna (@Yumna) 1681231625 The last mass eviction of Evyatar took place in June 2021. However, while the Israeli military says the outpost is \"flagrantly illegal,\" scores of homes have been built there with soldiers' help and the government has provided the community with electricity, water, and roads.On February 27\u2014the day after settlers' deadly rampage through the Palestinian town of Huwara\u2014Ben-Gvir, who leads the Jewish Power party, defiantly organized a rally in Evyatar, where he called for the assassination of \"terrorists\" who resist Israeli expansion.Netanyahu's government is seeking to \"legalize\" Evyatar as it did for nine other settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem earlier this year. When asked by Haaretz why Evyatar has not yet been legalized, Zvi Sukkot, an Israeli lawmaker representing the Religious Zionism party, said that \"legalizing such an outpost takes time.\"\"We're not afraid of America,\" he added. The Biden administration says it opposes settlement expansion, even while lavishing Israel with billions of dollars in annual military aid and diplomatic cover.",

                  "description": "A Bitcoin-only policy organization in the United Kingdom seeks to steer a course for greater levels of BTC adoption.",
                  "content": "God save our gracious coin, and long live the coin. A team of entrepreneurs, environmentalists and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have assembled to back Bitcoin in Britain. Bitcoin Policy UK (BPUK) unites stakeholders, policymakers, environmentalists, tax specialists, Bitcoin experts and miners to \u201cunlock the potential of Bitcoin\u201d in Britain and explore how the decentralized currency\u2019s burgeoning industry could benefit U.K. households, businesses and communities. BPUK\u2019s primary objectives are to drive investment, generate and prepare students for the Bitcoin jobs of the future, raise awareness and education, and explore the use of wasted and stranded energy resources for Bitcoin mining. Freddie New, BPUK\u2019s head of policy, told Cointelegraph that \u201cthe genesis of this project was the Bitcoin Collective Conference in Edinburgh\u201d \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s largest Bitcoin conference, taking place in fall 2022 . New told Cointelegraph that most of the team had been working on Bitcoin advocacy in one way or another before the conference, \u201cbut coming together like this will enable us to formalize these efforts and focus on three key related areas.\u201d He continued: Some of the advisers and board members are familiar to Cointelegraph readers. Author and journalist DecentraSuze, whose son recently introduced Bitcoin to the classroom , is a director, while Jordan Walker, co-founder of The Bitcoin Collective , and Mark Morton are advisers. Morton\u2019s Bitcoin mining company, Scilling Digital Mining, was featured in a recent Cointelegraph mini-documentary: Walker told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is an important piece of the collective puzzle to drive Bitcoin education in the U.K.: New told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is not-for-profit. To operate, it hopes to raise funds through the community, tapping into the growing trend of funding projects with satoshis , or small amounts of BTC, via the Lightning Network, a layer-2 instant payment solution built atop Bitcoin. Part of the team\u2019s mission is to locate and harness renewable, wasted or stranded energy across the U.K., New explained. He continued with the plan: \u201cWe can then invite British policymakers to these sites so they can see mines in action and hopefully understand more about the industry\u2019s potential to mitigate vented methane, provide demand response for renewable grids, or simply act as a customer for energy that is otherwise wasted.\u201d The U.K. has burgeoning renewable energy sources but lacks in hash rate (a measure of the Bitcoin protocol\u2019s security). According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the U.K. supports 0.23% of the global monthly hash rate, compared with the United States\u2019 37.84%. This is partly due to electricity costs in the U.K. exceeding those of the U.S. and Asia, but also due to Bitcoin mining awareness \u2014 or a lack thereof \u2014 in the U.K. Moreover, legacy media platforms have taken aim at the Bitcoin mining industry in recent years \u2014 the Guardian critiqued Bitcoin as \u201cdigital beef\u201d instead of \u201cdigital gold.\u201d BPUK highlighted that in light of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union, it could develop a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency regime separate from that of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in Europe. The European parliamentary committee on MiCA may threaten Bitcoin mining on the continent . BPUK co-founder Krista Edmunds took inspiration from El Salvador\u2019s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Edmunds explained: On the governmental side, the policy group will have an opportunity to educate and inform. Lisa Cameron, a member of Parliament and chairperson of the Crypto and Digital Assets All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), told Cointelegraph in an interview last year: \u201cWe are on a learning curve, and it\u2019s just very, very important because the U.K. government has a policy vision that the U.K. will become an international hub of cryptocurrency and digital assets.\u201d She added that there was some confusion surrounding Bitcoin, central bank digital currencies and cryptocurrency. New explained that as a Bitcoin-only organization, the BPUK ultimately seeks to \u201cmake sure that Bitcoin is included in the government\u2019s proposals, if not at the front and center.\"",

                  "description": "In what Palestine defenders and even one mainstream U.S. Jewish group called a perilous provocation, leaders of Israel's far-right government accompanied thousands of settlers shielded by a heavy military presence on a Monday march to an illegal colony in the occupied West Bank.Senior officials in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right Cabinet\u2014including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich\u2014and numerous right-wing lawmakers joined a crowd of as many as 20,000 pro-apartheid demonstrators who marched to Evyatar in a bid to legitimize the outpost, The Times of Israel reports.According to Haaretz, 22 Palestinians including residents of the nearby town of Beita were wounded when Israeli occupation forces fired on them with less-lethal weapons including rubber-tipped steel bullets during and after the march. More than 100 people including journalists also suffered from inhaling gas used by Israeli forces to disperse counter-demonstrators. At least two journalists were hospitalized as a result of their injuries. Meanwhile, marchers brought inflatable bouncy houses and other amusements to entertain children during the demonstration. \\u201cThousands of Israeli settlers marched through the northern West Bank today towards the Palestinian village of Beita flanked by Israeli regime forces. \\n\\nAmong them were dozens of Israeli regime ministers & lawmakers. \\n\\nMeanwhile Palestinians were tear gassed & their roads closed.\\u201d \u2014 Dr. Yara Hawari \\u062f. \\u064a\\u0627\\u0631\\u0627 \\u0647\\u0648\\u0627\\u0631\\u064a (@Dr. Yara Hawari \\u062f. \\u064a\\u0627\\u0631\\u0627 \\u0647\\u0648\\u0627\\u0631\\u064a) 1681137061 The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the march as \"a dangerous escalation and provocation of the Palestinian people and an extension of the incitement calls of the Israeli right and the fascist right to deepen settlement at the expense of land.\" Yumna Patel, Palestine news director at Mondoweiss, said on Twitter: \"The cognitive dissonance is truly astounding. Israeli settlers march on stolen land, in a settler colony that's given them the land to steal and colonize, alongside an army whose singular goal is to protect them. And yet, somehow, they are the victims in their own narrative.\"The liberal U.S. Jewish group J Street also condemned the march, tweeting that \"this is an incendiary and deeply dangerous act by some of the most senior ministers in the Israeli government.\"\"Their vision is clear: annexation, endless conflict, and chaos,\" the group added. \\u201cFar-right Israeli ministers join settler march for illegal Evyatar outpost\\n\\nIsraeli settlers marched near Nablus in the occupied West Bank to demand the re-establishment and legalisation of the evacuated illegal outpost of Evyatar (Avitar) near the Palestinian town of Beita\\u201d \u2014 Middle East Monitor (@Middle East Monitor) 1681207188 However, Ben-Gvir\u2014who is a settler\u2014asserted that \"we are here, and we are marching toward the future... I hope the entire state of Israel understands this.\"Smotrich told Haaretz while marching that \"God willing, we'll bring here another half-million Jews on top the half-million that are already here.\" United Nations experts say the true number of Israeli settlers colonizing the West Bank and East Jerusalem is closer to 700,000.Evyatar, an exclusively Jewish community first established in 2013, is built on stolen Palestinian land on Mount Sabih in Beita, south of Nablus. The settlement is illegal under both international and Israeli law and has been repeatedly destroyed by Israeli authorities. Since 1967, at least 77 Beita residents have been killed by Israeli forces, many of them during protests, according to Patel. \\u201cThe Palestinians in Beit have been protesting against the Evyatar outpost since 2021. At least 7 people, including 2 children, from the town have been killed over the course of the protests. We covered Beita's fight against the outpost back in 2021 https://t.co/Nw4aLS7LzD\\u201d \u2014 Yumna (@Yumna) 1681231625 The last mass eviction of Evyatar took place in June 2021. However, while the Israeli military says the outpost is \"flagrantly illegal,\" scores of homes have been built there with soldiers' help and the government has provided the community with electricity, water, and roads.On February 27\u2014the day after settlers' deadly rampage through the Palestinian town of Huwara\u2014Ben-Gvir, who leads the Jewish Power party, defiantly organized a rally in Evyatar, where he called for the assassination of \"terrorists\" who resist Israeli expansion.Netanyahu's government is seeking to \"legalize\" Evyatar as it did for nine other settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem earlier this year. When asked by Haaretz why Evyatar has not yet been legalized, Zvi Sukkot, an Israeli lawmaker representing the Religious Zionism party, said that \"legalizing such an outpost takes time.\"\"We're not afraid of America,\" he added. The Biden administration says it opposes settlement expansion, even while lavishing Israel with billions of dollars in annual military aid and diplomatic cover.",

Bitcoin Policy UK (BPUK) unites stakeholders, policymakers, environmentalists, tax specialists, Bitcoin experts and miners to \u201cunlock the potential of Bitcoin\u201d in Britain and explore how the decentralized currency\u2019s burgeoning industry could benefit U.K. households, businesses and communities. BPUK\u2019s primary objectives are to drive investment, generate and prepare students for the Bitcoin jobs of the future, raise awareness and education, and explore the use of wasted and stranded energy resources for Bitcoin mining. Freddie New, BPUK\u2019s head of policy, told Cointelegraph that \u201cthe genesis of this project was the Bitcoin Collective Conference in Edinburgh\u201d \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s largest Bitcoin conference, taking place in fall 2022 . New told Cointelegraph that most of the team had been working on Bitcoin advocacy in one way or another before the conference, \u201cbut coming together like this will enable us to formalize these efforts and focus on three key related areas.\u201d He continued: Some of the advisers and board members are familiar to Cointelegraph readers. Author and journalist DecentraSuze, whose son recently introduced Bitcoin to the classroom , is a director, while Jordan Walker, co-founder of The Bitcoin Collective , and Mark Morton are advisers. Morton\u2019s Bitcoin mining company, Scilling Digital Mining, was featured in a recent Cointelegraph mini-documentary: Walker told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is an important piece of the collective puzzle to drive Bitcoin education in the U.K.: New told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is not-for-profit. To operate, it hopes to raise funds through the community, tapping into the growing trend of funding projects with satoshis , or small amounts of BTC, via the Lightning Network, a layer-2 instant payment solution built atop Bitcoin. Part of the team\u2019s mission is to locate and harness renewable, wasted or stranded energy across the U.K., New explained. He continued with the plan: \u201cWe can then invite British policymakers to these sites so they can see mines in action and hopefully understand more about the industry\u2019s potential to mitigate vented methane, provide demand response for renewable grids, or simply act as a customer for energy that is otherwise wasted.\u201d The U.K. has burgeoning renewable energy sources but lacks in hash rate (a measure of the Bitcoin protocol\u2019s security). According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the U.K. supports 0.23% of the global monthly hash rate, compared with the United States\u2019 37.84%. This is partly due to electricity costs in the U.K. exceeding those of the U.S. and Asia, but also due to Bitcoin mining awareness \u2014 or a lack thereof \u2014 in the U.K. Moreover, legacy media platforms have taken aim at the Bitcoin mining industry in recent years \u2014 the Guardian critiqued Bitcoin as \u201cdigital beef\u201d instead of \u201cdigital gold.\u201d BPUK highlighted that in light of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union, it could develop a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency regime separate from that of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in Europe. The European parliamentary committee on MiCA may threaten Bitcoin mining on the continent . BPUK co-founder Krista Edmunds took inspiration from El Salvador\u2019s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Edmunds explained: On the governmental side, the policy group will have an opportunity to educate and inform. Lisa Cameron, a member of Parliament and chairperson of the Crypto and Digital Assets All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), told Cointelegraph in an interview last year: \u201cWe are on a learning curve, and it\u2019s just very, very important because the U.K. government has a policy vision that the U.K. will become an international hub of cryptocurrency and digital assets.\u201d She added that there was some confusion surrounding Bitcoin, central bank digital currencies and cryptocurrency. New explained that as a Bitcoin-only organization, the BPUK ultimately seeks to \u201cmake sure that Bitcoin is included in the government\u2019s proposals, if not at the front and center.\"",

More than 100 people including journalists also suffered from inhaling gas used by Israeli forces to disperse counter-demonstrators. At least two journalists were hospitalized as a result of their injuries. Meanwhile, marchers brought inflatable bouncy houses and other amusements to entertain children during the demonstration. \\u201cThousands of Israeli settlers marched through the northern West Bank today towards the Palestinian village of Beita flanked by Israeli regime forces. \\n\\nAmong them were dozens of Israeli regime ministers & lawmakers. \\n\\nMeanwhile Palestinians were tear gassed & their roads closed.\\u201d \u2014 Dr. Yara Hawari \\u062f. \\u064a\\u0627\\u0631\\u0627 \\u0647\\u0648\\u0627\\u0631\\u064a (@Dr. Yara Hawari \\u062f. \\u064a\\u0627\\u0631\\u0627 \\u0647\\u0648\\u0627\\u0631\\u064a) 1681137061 The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the march as \"a dangerous escalation and provocation of the Palestinian people and an extension of the incitement calls of the Israeli right and the fascist right to deepen settlement at the expense of land.\" Yumna Patel, Palestine news director at Mondoweiss, said on Twitter: \"The cognitive dissonance is truly astounding. Israeli settlers march on stolen land, in a settler colony that's given them the land to steal and colonize, alongside an army whose singular goal is to protect them. And yet, somehow, they are the victims in their own narrative.\"The liberal U.S. Jewish group J Street also condemned the march, tweeting that \"this is an incendiary and deeply dangerous act by some of the most senior ministers in the Israeli government.\"\"Their vision is clear: annexation, endless conflict, and chaos,\" the group added. \\u201cFar-right Israeli ministers join settler march for illegal Evyatar outpost\\n\\nIsraeli settlers marched near Nablus in the occupied West Bank to demand the re-establishment and legalisation of the evacuated illegal outpost of Evyatar (Avitar) near the Palestinian town of Beita\\u201d \u2014 Middle East Monitor (@Middle East Monitor) 1681207188 However, Ben-Gvir\u2014who is a settler\u2014asserted that \"we are here, and we are marching toward the future... I hope the entire state of Israel understands this.\"Smotrich told Haaretz while marching that \"God willing, we'll bring here another half-million Jews on top the half-million that are already here.\" United Nations experts say the true number of Israeli settlers colonizing the West Bank and East Jerusalem is closer to 700,000.Evyatar, an exclusively Jewish community first established in 2013, is built on stolen Palestinian land on Mount Sabih in Beita, south of Nablus. The settlement is illegal under both international and Israeli law and has been repeatedly destroyed by Israeli authorities. Since 1967, at least 77 Beita residents have been killed by Israeli forces, many of them during protests, according to Patel. \\u201cThe Palestinians in Beit have been protesting against the Evyatar outpost since 2021. At least 7 people, including 2 children, from the town have been killed over the course of the protests. We covered Beita's fight against the outpost back in 2021 https://t.co/Nw4aLS7LzD\\u201d \u2014 Yumna (@Yumna) 1681231625 The last mass eviction of Evyatar took place in June 2021. However, while the Israeli military says the outpost is \"flagrantly illegal,\" scores of homes have been built there with soldiers' help and the government has provided the community with electricity, water, and roads.On February 27\u2014the day after settlers' deadly rampage through the Palestinian town of Huwara\u2014Ben-Gvir, who leads the Jewish Power party, defiantly organized a rally in Evyatar, where he called for the assassination of \"terrorists\" who resist Israeli expansion.Netanyahu's government is seeking to \"legalize\" Evyatar as it did for nine other settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem earlier this year. When asked by Haaretz why Evyatar has not yet been legalized, Zvi Sukkot, an Israeli lawmaker representing the Religious Zionism party, said that \"legalizing such an outpost takes time.\"\"We're not afraid of America,\" he added. The Biden administration says it opposes settlement expansion, even while lavishing Israel with billions of dollars in annual military aid and diplomatic cover.",

                  "description": "A Bitcoin-only policy organization in the United Kingdom seeks to steer a course for greater levels of BTC adoption.",
                  "content": "God save our gracious coin, and long live the coin. A team of entrepreneurs, environmentalists and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have assembled to back Bitcoin in Britain. Bitcoin Policy UK (BPUK) unites stakeholders, policymakers, environmentalists, tax specialists, Bitcoin experts and miners to \u201cunlock the potential of Bitcoin\u201d in Britain and explore how the decentralized currency\u2019s burgeoning industry could benefit U.K. households, businesses and communities. BPUK\u2019s primary objectives are to drive investment, generate and prepare students for the Bitcoin jobs of the future, raise awareness and education, and explore the use of wasted and stranded energy resources for Bitcoin mining. Freddie New, BPUK\u2019s head of policy, told Cointelegraph that \u201cthe genesis of this project was the Bitcoin Collective Conference in Edinburgh\u201d \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s largest Bitcoin conference, taking place in fall 2022 . New told Cointelegraph that most of the team had been working on Bitcoin advocacy in one way or another before the conference, \u201cbut coming together like this will enable us to formalize these efforts and focus on three key related areas.\u201d He continued: Some of the advisers and board members are familiar to Cointelegraph readers. Author and journalist DecentraSuze, whose son recently introduced Bitcoin to the classroom , is a director, while Jordan Walker, co-founder of The Bitcoin Collective , and Mark Morton are advisers. Morton\u2019s Bitcoin mining company, Scilling Digital Mining, was featured in a recent Cointelegraph mini-documentary: Walker told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is an important piece of the collective puzzle to drive Bitcoin education in the U.K.: New told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is not-for-profit. To operate, it hopes to raise funds through the community, tapping into the growing trend of funding projects with satoshis , or small amounts of BTC, via the Lightning Network, a layer-2 instant payment solution built atop Bitcoin. Part of the team\u2019s mission is to locate and harness renewable, wasted or stranded energy across the U.K., New explained. He continued with the plan: \u201cWe can then invite British policymakers to these sites so they can see mines in action and hopefully understand more about the industry\u2019s potential to mitigate vented methane, provide demand response for renewable grids, or simply act as a customer for energy that is otherwise wasted.\u201d The U.K. has burgeoning renewable energy sources but lacks in hash rate (a measure of the Bitcoin protocol\u2019s security). According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the U.K. supports 0.23% of the global monthly hash rate, compared with the United States\u2019 37.84%. This is partly due to electricity costs in the U.K. exceeding those of the U.S. and Asia, but also due to Bitcoin mining awareness \u2014 or a lack thereof \u2014 in the U.K. Moreover, legacy media platforms have taken aim at the Bitcoin mining industry in recent years \u2014 the Guardian critiqued Bitcoin as \u201cdigital beef\u201d instead of \u201cdigital gold.\u201d BPUK highlighted that in light of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union, it could develop a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency regime separate from that of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in Europe. The European parliamentary committee on MiCA may threaten Bitcoin mining on the continent . BPUK co-founder Krista Edmunds took inspiration from El Salvador\u2019s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Edmunds explained: On the governmental side, the policy group will have an opportunity to educate and inform. Lisa Cameron, a member of Parliament and chairperson of the Crypto and Digital Assets All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), told Cointelegraph in an interview last year: \u201cWe are on a learning curve, and it\u2019s just very, very important because the U.K. government has a policy vision that the U.K. will become an international hub of cryptocurrency and digital assets.\u201d She added that there was some confusion surrounding Bitcoin, central bank digital currencies and cryptocurrency. New explained that as a Bitcoin-only organization, the BPUK ultimately seeks to \u201cmake sure that Bitcoin is included in the government\u2019s proposals, if not at the front and center.\"",

                  "description": "In what Palestine defenders and even one mainstream U.S. Jewish group called a perilous provocation, leaders of Israel's far-right government accompanied thousands of settlers shielded by a heavy military presence on a Monday march to an illegal colony in the occupied West Bank.Senior officials in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right Cabinet\u2014including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich\u2014and numerous right-wing lawmakers joined a crowd of as many as 20,000 pro-apartheid demonstrators who marched to Evyatar in a bid to legitimize the outpost, The Times of Israel reports.According to Haaretz, 22 Palestinians including residents of the nearby town of Beita were wounded when Israeli occupation forces fired on them with less-lethal weapons including rubber-tipped steel bullets during and after the march. More than 100 people including journalists also suffered from inhaling gas used by Israeli forces to disperse counter-demonstrators. At least two journalists were hospitalized as a result of their injuries. Meanwhile, marchers brought inflatable bouncy houses and other amusements to entertain children during the demonstration. \\u201cThousands of Israeli settlers marched through the northern West Bank today towards the Palestinian village of Beita flanked by Israeli regime forces. \\n\\nAmong them were dozens of Israeli regime ministers & lawmakers. \\n\\nMeanwhile Palestinians were tear gassed & their roads closed.\\u201d \u2014 Dr. Yara Hawari \\u062f. \\u064a\\u0627\\u0631\\u0627 \\u0647\\u0648\\u0627\\u0631\\u064a (@Dr. Yara Hawari \\u062f. \\u064a\\u0627\\u0631\\u0627 \\u0647\\u0648\\u0627\\u0631\\u064a) 1681137061 The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the march as \"a dangerous escalation and provocation of the Palestinian people and an extension of the incitement calls of the Israeli right and the fascist right to deepen settlement at the expense of land.\" Yumna Patel, Palestine news director at Mondoweiss, said on Twitter: \"The cognitive dissonance is truly astounding. Israeli settlers march on stolen land, in a settler colony that's given them the land to steal and colonize, alongside an army whose singular goal is to protect them. And yet, somehow, they are the victims in their own narrative.\"The liberal U.S. Jewish group J Street also condemned the march, tweeting that \"this is an incendiary and deeply dangerous act by some of the most senior ministers in the Israeli government.\"\"Their vision is clear: annexation, endless conflict, and chaos,\" the group added. \\u201cFar-right Israeli ministers join settler march for illegal Evyatar outpost\\n\\nIsraeli settlers marched near Nablus in the occupied West Bank to demand the re-establishment and legalisation of the evacuated illegal outpost of Evyatar (Avitar) near the Palestinian town of Beita\\u201d \u2014 Middle East Monitor (@Middle East Monitor) 1681207188 However, Ben-Gvir\u2014who is a settler\u2014asserted that \"we are here, and we are marching toward the future... I hope the entire state of Israel understands this.\"Smotrich told Haaretz while marching that \"God willing, we'll bring here another half-million Jews on top the half-million that are already here.\" United Nations experts say the true number of Israeli settlers colonizing the West Bank and East Jerusalem is closer to 700,000.Evyatar, an exclusively Jewish community first established in 2013, is built on stolen Palestinian land on Mount Sabih in Beita, south of Nablus. The settlement is illegal under both international and Israeli law and has been repeatedly destroyed by Israeli authorities. Since 1967, at least 77 Beita residents have been killed by Israeli forces, many of them during protests, according to Patel. \\u201cThe Palestinians in Beit have been protesting against the Evyatar outpost since 2021. At least 7 people, including 2 children, from the town have been killed over the course of the protests. We covered Beita's fight against the outpost back in 2021 https://t.co/Nw4aLS7LzD\\u201d \u2014 Yumna (@Yumna) 1681231625 The last mass eviction of Evyatar took place in June 2021. However, while the Israeli military says the outpost is \"flagrantly illegal,\" scores of homes have been built there with soldiers' help and the government has provided the community with electricity, water, and roads.On February 27\u2014the day after settlers' deadly rampage through the Palestinian town of Huwara\u2014Ben-Gvir, who leads the Jewish Power party, defiantly organized a rally in Evyatar, where he called for the assassination of \"terrorists\" who resist Israeli expansion.Netanyahu's government is seeking to \"legalize\" Evyatar as it did for nine other settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem earlier this year. When asked by Haaretz why Evyatar has not yet been legalized, Zvi Sukkot, an Israeli lawmaker representing the Religious Zionism party, said that \"legalizing such an outpost takes time.\"\"We're not afraid of America,\" he added. The Biden administration says it opposes settlement expansion, even while lavishing Israel with billions of dollars in annual military aid and diplomatic cover.",

                  "description": "A Bitcoin-only policy organization in the United Kingdom seeks to steer a course for greater levels of BTC adoption.",
                  "content": "God save our gracious coin, and long live the coin. A team of entrepreneurs, environmentalists and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have assembled to back Bitcoin in Britain. Bitcoin Policy UK (BPUK) unites stakeholders, policymakers, environmentalists, tax specialists, Bitcoin experts and miners to \u201cunlock the potential of Bitcoin\u201d in Britain and explore how the decentralized currency\u2019s burgeoning industry could benefit U.K. households, businesses and communities. BPUK\u2019s primary objectives are to drive investment, generate and prepare students for the Bitcoin jobs of the future, raise awareness and education, and explore the use of wasted and stranded energy resources for Bitcoin mining. Freddie New, BPUK\u2019s head of policy, told Cointelegraph that \u201cthe genesis of this project was the Bitcoin Collective Conference in Edinburgh\u201d \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s largest Bitcoin conference, taking place in fall 2022 . New told Cointelegraph that most of the team had been working on Bitcoin advocacy in one way or another before the conference, \u201cbut coming together like this will enable us to formalize these efforts and focus on three key related areas.\u201d He continued: Some of the advisers and board members are familiar to Cointelegraph readers. Author and journalist DecentraSuze, whose son recently introduced Bitcoin to the classroom , is a director, while Jordan Walker, co-founder of The Bitcoin Collective , and Mark Morton are advisers. Morton\u2019s Bitcoin mining company, Scilling Digital Mining, was featured in a recent Cointelegraph mini-documentary: Walker told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is an important piece of the collective puzzle to drive Bitcoin education in the U.K.: New told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is not-for-profit. To operate, it hopes to raise funds through the community, tapping into the growing trend of funding projects with satoshis , or small amounts of BTC, via the Lightning Network, a layer-2 instant payment solution built atop Bitcoin. Part of the team\u2019s mission is to locate and harness renewable, wasted or stranded energy across the U.K., New explained. He continued with the plan: \u201cWe can then invite British policymakers to these sites so they can see mines in action and hopefully understand more about the industry\u2019s potential to mitigate vented methane, provide demand response for renewable grids, or simply act as a customer for energy that is otherwise wasted.\u201d The U.K. has burgeoning renewable energy sources but lacks in hash rate (a measure of the Bitcoin protocol\u2019s security). According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the U.K. supports 0.23% of the global monthly hash rate, compared with the United States\u2019 37.84%. This is partly due to electricity costs in the U.K. exceeding those of the U.S. and Asia, but also due to Bitcoin mining awareness \u2014 or a lack thereof \u2014 in the U.K. Moreover, legacy media platforms have taken aim at the Bitcoin mining industry in recent years \u2014 the Guardian critiqued Bitcoin as \u201cdigital beef\u201d instead of \u201cdigital gold.\u201d BPUK highlighted that in light of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union, it could develop a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency regime separate from that of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in Europe. The European parliamentary committee on MiCA may threaten Bitcoin mining on the continent . BPUK co-founder Krista Edmunds took inspiration from El Salvador\u2019s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Edmunds explained: On the governmental side, the policy group will have an opportunity to educate and inform. Lisa Cameron, a member of Parliament and chairperson of the Crypto and Digital Assets All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), told Cointelegraph in an interview last year: \u201cWe are on a learning curve, and it\u2019s just very, very important because the U.K. government has a policy vision that the U.K. will become an international hub of cryptocurrency and digital assets.\u201d She added that there was some confusion surrounding Bitcoin, central bank digital currencies and cryptocurrency. New explained that as a Bitcoin-only organization, the BPUK ultimately seeks to \u201cmake sure that Bitcoin is included in the government\u2019s proposals, if not at the front and center.\"",

                  "description": "In what Palestine defenders and even one mainstream U.S. Jewish group called a perilous provocation, leaders of Israel's far-right government accompanied thousands of settlers shielded by a heavy military presence on a Monday march to an illegal colony in the occupied West Bank.Senior officials in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right Cabinet\u2014including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich\u2014and numerous right-wing lawmakers joined a crowd of as many as 20,000 pro-apartheid demonstrators who marched to Evyatar in a bid to legitimize the outpost, The Times of Israel reports.According to Haaretz, 22 Palestinians including residents of the nearby town of Beita were wounded when Israeli occupation forces fired on them with less-lethal weapons including rubber-tipped steel bullets during and after the march. More than 100 people including journalists also suffered from inhaling gas used by Israeli forces to disperse counter-demonstrators. At least two journalists were hospitalized as a result of their injuries. Meanwhile, marchers brought inflatable bouncy houses and other amusements to entertain children during the demonstration. \\u201cThousands of Israeli settlers marched through the northern West Bank today towards the Palestinian village of Beita flanked by Israeli regime forces. \\n\\nAmong them were dozens of Israeli regime ministers & lawmakers. \\n\\nMeanwhile Palestinians were tear gassed & their roads closed.\\u201d \u2014 Dr. Yara Hawari \\u062f. \\u064a\\u0627\\u0631\\u0627 \\u0647\\u0648\\u0627\\u0631\\u064a (@Dr. Yara Hawari \\u062f. \\u064a\\u0627\\u0631\\u0627 \\u0647\\u0648\\u0627\\u0631\\u064a) 1681137061 The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the march as \"a dangerous escalation and provocation of the Palestinian people and an extension of the incitement calls of the Israeli right and the fascist right to deepen settlement at the expense of land.\" Yumna Patel, Palestine news director at Mondoweiss, said on Twitter: \"The cognitive dissonance is truly astounding. Israeli settlers march on stolen land, in a settler colony that's given them the land to steal and colonize, alongside an army whose singular goal is to protect them. And yet, somehow, they are the victims in their own narrative.\"The liberal U.S. Jewish group J Street also condemned the march, tweeting that \"this is an incendiary and deeply dangerous act by some of the most senior ministers in the Israeli government.\"\"Their vision is clear: annexation, endless conflict, and chaos,\" the group added. \\u201cFar-right Israeli ministers join settler march for illegal Evyatar outpost\\n\\nIsraeli settlers marched near Nablus in the occupied West Bank to demand the re-establishment and legalisation of the evacuated illegal outpost of Evyatar (Avitar) near the Palestinian town of Beita\\u201d \u2014 Middle East Monitor (@Middle East Monitor) 1681207188 However, Ben-Gvir\u2014who is a settler\u2014asserted that \"we are here, and we are marching toward the future... I hope the entire state of Israel understands this.\"Smotrich told Haaretz while marching that \"God willing, we'll bring here another half-million Jews on top the half-million that are already here.\" United Nations experts say the true number of Israeli settlers colonizing the West Bank and East Jerusalem is closer to 700,000.Evyatar, an exclusively Jewish community first established in 2013, is built on stolen Palestinian land on Mount Sabih in Beita, south of Nablus. The settlement is illegal under both international and Israeli law and has been repeatedly destroyed by Israeli authorities. Since 1967, at least 77 Beita residents have been killed by Israeli forces, many of them during protests, according to Patel. \\u201cThe Palestinians in Beit have been protesting against the Evyatar outpost since 2021. At least 7 people, including 2 children, from the town have been killed over the course of the protests. We covered Beita's fight against the outpost back in 2021 https://t.co/Nw4aLS7LzD\\u201d \u2014 Yumna (@Yumna) 1681231625 The last mass eviction of Evyatar took place in June 2021. However, while the Israeli military says the outpost is \"flagrantly illegal,\" scores of homes have been built there with soldiers' help and the government has provided the community with electricity, water, and roads.On February 27\u2014the day after settlers' deadly rampage through the Palestinian town of Huwara\u2014Ben-Gvir, who leads the Jewish Power party, defiantly organized a rally in Evyatar, where he called for the assassination of \"terrorists\" who resist Israeli expansion.Netanyahu's government is seeking to \"legalize\" Evyatar as it did for nine other settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem earlier this year. When asked by Haaretz why Evyatar has not yet been legalized, Zvi Sukkot, an Israeli lawmaker representing the Religious Zionism party, said that \"legalizing such an outpost takes time.\"\"We're not afraid of America,\" he added. The Biden administration says it opposes settlement expansion, even while lavishing Israel with billions of dollars in annual military aid and diplomatic cover.",

                  "description": "A Bitcoin-only policy organization in the United Kingdom seeks to steer a course for greater levels of BTC adoption.",
                  "content": "God save our gracious coin, and long live the coin. A team of entrepreneurs, environmentalists and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have assembled to back Bitcoin in Britain. Bitcoin Policy UK (BPUK) unites stakeholders, policymakers, environmentalists, tax specialists, Bitcoin experts and miners to \u201cunlock the potential of Bitcoin\u201d in Britain and explore how the decentralized currency\u2019s burgeoning industry could benefit U.K. households, businesses and communities. BPUK\u2019s primary objectives are to drive investment, generate and prepare students for the Bitcoin jobs of the future, raise awareness and education, and explore the use of wasted and stranded energy resources for Bitcoin mining. Freddie New, BPUK\u2019s head of policy, told Cointelegraph that \u201cthe genesis of this project was the Bitcoin Collective Conference in Edinburgh\u201d \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s largest Bitcoin conference, taking place in fall 2022 . New told Cointelegraph that most of the team had been working on Bitcoin advocacy in one way or another before the conference, \u201cbut coming together like this will enable us to formalize these efforts and focus on three key related areas.\u201d He continued: Some of the advisers and board members are familiar to Cointelegraph readers. Author and journalist DecentraSuze, whose son recently introduced Bitcoin to the classroom , is a director, while Jordan Walker, co-founder of The Bitcoin Collective , and Mark Morton are advisers. Morton\u2019s Bitcoin mining company, Scilling Digital Mining, was featured in a recent Cointelegraph mini-documentary: Walker told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is an important piece of the collective puzzle to drive Bitcoin education in the U.K.: New told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is not-for-profit. To operate, it hopes to raise funds through the community, tapping into the growing trend of funding projects with satoshis , or small amounts of BTC, via the Lightning Network, a layer-2 instant payment solution built atop Bitcoin. Part of the team\u2019s mission is to locate and harness renewable, wasted or stranded energy across the U.K., New explained. He continued with the plan: \u201cWe can then invite British policymakers to these sites so they can see mines in action and hopefully understand more about the industry\u2019s potential to mitigate vented methane, provide demand response for renewable grids, or simply act as a customer for energy that is otherwise wasted.\u201d The U.K. has burgeoning renewable energy sources but lacks in hash rate (a measure of the Bitcoin protocol\u2019s security). According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the U.K. supports 0.23% of the global monthly hash rate, compared with the United States\u2019 37.84%. This is partly due to electricity costs in the U.K. exceeding those of the U.S. and Asia, but also due to Bitcoin mining awareness \u2014 or a lack thereof \u2014 in the U.K. Moreover, legacy media platforms have taken aim at the Bitcoin mining industry in recent years \u2014 the Guardian critiqued Bitcoin as \u201cdigital beef\u201d instead of \u201cdigital gold.\u201d BPUK highlighted that in light of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union, it could develop a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency regime separate from that of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in Europe. The European parliamentary committee on MiCA may threaten Bitcoin mining on the continent . BPUK co-founder Krista Edmunds took inspiration from El Salvador\u2019s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Edmunds explained: On the governmental side, the policy group will have an opportunity to educate and inform. Lisa Cameron, a member of Parliament and chairperson of the Crypto and Digital Assets All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), told Cointelegraph in an interview last year: \u201cWe are on a learning curve, and it\u2019s just very, very important because the U.K. government has a policy vision that the U.K. will become an international hub of cryptocurrency and digital assets.\u201d She added that there was some confusion surrounding Bitcoin, central bank digital currencies and cryptocurrency. New explained that as a Bitcoin-only organization, the BPUK ultimately seeks to \u201cmake sure that Bitcoin is included in the government\u2019s proposals, if not at the front and center.\"",

                  "description": "In what Palestine defenders and even one mainstream U.S. Jewish group called a perilous provocation, leaders of Israel's far-right government accompanied thousands of settlers shielded by a heavy military presence on a Monday march to an illegal colony in the occupied West Bank.Senior officials in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right Cabinet\u2014including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich\u2014and numerous right-wing lawmakers joined a crowd of as many as 20,000 pro-apartheid demonstrators who marched to Evyatar in a bid to legitimize the outpost, The Times of Israel reports.According to Haaretz, 22 Palestinians including residents of the nearby town of Beita were wounded when Israeli occupation forces fired on them with less-lethal weapons including rubber-tipped steel bullets during and after the march. More than 100 people including journalists also suffered from inhaling gas used by Israeli forces to disperse counter-demonstrators. At least two journalists were hospitalized as a result of their injuries. Meanwhile, marchers brought inflatable bouncy houses and other amusements to entertain children during the demonstration. \\u201cThousands of Israeli settlers marched through the northern West Bank today towards the Palestinian village of Beita flanked by Israeli regime forces. \\n\\nAmong them were dozens of Israeli regime ministers & lawmakers. \\n\\nMeanwhile Palestinians were tear gassed & their roads closed.\\u201d \u2014 Dr. Yara Hawari \\u062f. \\u064a\\u0627\\u0631\\u0627 \\u0647\\u0648\\u0627\\u0631\\u064a (@Dr. Yara Hawari \\u062f. \\u064a\\u0627\\u0631\\u0627 \\u0647\\u0648\\u0627\\u0631\\u064a) 1681137061 The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the march as \"a dangerous escalation and provocation of the Palestinian people and an extension of the incitement calls of the Israeli right and the fascist right to deepen settlement at the expense of land.\" Yumna Patel, Palestine news director at Mondoweiss, said on Twitter: \"The cognitive dissonance is truly astounding. Israeli settlers march on stolen land, in a settler colony that's given them the land to steal and colonize, alongside an army whose singular goal is to protect them. And yet, somehow, they are the victims in their own narrative.\"The liberal U.S. Jewish group J Street also condemned the march, tweeting that \"this is an incendiary and deeply dangerous act by some of the most senior ministers in the Israeli government.\"\"Their vision is clear: annexation, endless conflict, and chaos,\" the group added. \\u201cFar-right Israeli ministers join settler march for illegal Evyatar outpost\\n\\nIsraeli settlers marched near Nablus in the occupied West Bank to demand the re-establishment and legalisation of the evacuated illegal outpost of Evyatar (Avitar) near the Palestinian town of Beita\\u201d \u2014 Middle East Monitor (@Middle East Monitor) 1681207188 However, Ben-Gvir\u2014who is a settler\u2014asserted that \"we are here, and we are marching toward the future... I hope the entire state of Israel understands this.\"Smotrich told Haaretz while marching that \"God willing, we'll bring here another half-million Jews on top the half-million that are already here.\" United Nations experts say the true number of Israeli settlers colonizing the West Bank and East Jerusalem is closer to 700,000.Evyatar, an exclusively Jewish community first established in 2013, is built on stolen Palestinian land on Mount Sabih in Beita, south of Nablus. The settlement is illegal under both international and Israeli law and has been repeatedly destroyed by Israeli authorities. Since 1967, at least 77 Beita residents have been killed by Israeli forces, many of them during protests, according to Patel. \\u201cThe Palestinians in Beit have been protesting against the Evyatar outpost since 2021. At least 7 people, including 2 children, from the town have been killed over the course of the protests. We covered Beita's fight against the outpost back in 2021 https://t.co/Nw4aLS7LzD\\u201d \u2014 Yumna (@Yumna) 1681231625 The last mass eviction of Evyatar took place in June 2021. However, while the Israeli military says the outpost is \"flagrantly illegal,\" scores of homes have been built there with soldiers' help and the government has provided the community with electricity, water, and roads.On February 27\u2014the day after settlers' deadly rampage through the Palestinian town of Huwara\u2014Ben-Gvir, who leads the Jewish Power party, defiantly organized a rally in Evyatar, where he called for the assassination of \"terrorists\" who resist Israeli expansion.Netanyahu's government is seeking to \"legalize\" Evyatar as it did for nine other settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem earlier this year. When asked by Haaretz why Evyatar has not yet been legalized, Zvi Sukkot, an Israeli lawmaker representing the Religious Zionism party, said that \"legalizing such an outpost takes time.\"\"We're not afraid of America,\" he added. The Biden administration says it opposes settlement expansion, even while lavishing Israel with billions of dollars in annual military aid and diplomatic cover.",

                  "content": "God save our gracious coin, and long live the coin. A team of entrepreneurs, environmentalists and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have assembled to back Bitcoin in Britain. Bitcoin Policy UK (BPUK) unites stakeholders, policymakers, environmentalists, tax specialists, Bitcoin experts and miners to \u201cunlock the potential of Bitcoin\u201d in Britain and explore how the decentralized currency\u2019s burgeoning industry could benefit U.K. households, businesses and communities. BPUK\u2019s primary objectives are to drive investment, generate and prepare students for the Bitcoin jobs of the future, raise awareness and education, and explore the use of wasted and stranded energy resources for Bitcoin mining. Freddie New, BPUK\u2019s head of policy, told Cointelegraph that \u201cthe genesis of this project was the Bitcoin Collective Conference in Edinburgh\u201d \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s largest Bitcoin conference, taking place in fall 2022 . New told Cointelegraph that most of the team had been working on Bitcoin advocacy in one way or another before the conference, \u201cbut coming together like this will enable us to formalize these efforts and focus on three key related areas.\u201d He continued: Some of the advisers and board members are familiar to Cointelegraph readers. Author and journalist DecentraSuze, whose son recently introduced Bitcoin to the classroom , is a director, while Jordan Walker, co-founder of The Bitcoin Collective , and Mark Morton are advisers. Morton\u2019s Bitcoin mining company, Scilling Digital Mining, was featured in a recent Cointelegraph mini-documentary: Walker told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is an important piece of the collective puzzle to drive Bitcoin education in the U.K.: New told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is not-for-profit. To operate, it hopes to raise funds through the community, tapping into the growing trend of funding projects with satoshis , or small amounts of BTC, via the Lightning Network, a layer-2 instant payment solution built atop Bitcoin. Part of the team\u2019s mission is to locate and harness renewable, wasted or stranded energy across the U.K., New explained. He continued with the plan: \u201cWe can then invite British policymakers to these sites so they can see mines in action and hopefully understand more about the industry\u2019s potential to mitigate vented methane, provide demand response for renewable grids, or simply act as a customer for energy that is otherwise wasted.\u201d The U.K. has burgeoning renewable energy sources but lacks in hash rate (a measure of the Bitcoin protocol\u2019s security). According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the U.K. supports 0.23% of the global monthly hash rate, compared with the United States\u2019 37.84%. This is partly due to electricity costs in the U.K. exceeding those of the U.S. and Asia, but also due to Bitcoin mining awareness \u2014 or a lack thereof \u2014 in the U.K. Moreover, legacy media platforms have taken aim at the Bitcoin mining industry in recent years \u2014 the Guardian critiqued Bitcoin as \u201cdigital beef\u201d instead of \u201cdigital gold.\u201d BPUK highlighted that in light of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union, it could develop a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency regime separate from that of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in Europe. The European parliamentary committee on MiCA may threaten Bitcoin mining on the continent . BPUK co-founder Krista Edmunds took inspiration from El Salvador\u2019s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Edmunds explained: On the governmental side, the policy group will have an opportunity to educate and inform. Lisa Cameron, a member of Parliament and chairperson of the Crypto and Digital Assets All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), told Cointelegraph in an interview last year: \u201cWe are on a learning curve, and it\u2019s just very, very important because the U.K. government has a policy vision that the U.K. will become an international hub of cryptocurrency and digital assets.\u201d She added that there was some confusion surrounding Bitcoin, central bank digital currencies and cryptocurrency. New explained that as a Bitcoin-only organization, the BPUK ultimately seeks to \u201cmake sure that Bitcoin is included in the government\u2019s proposals, if not at the front and center.\"",

More than 100 people including journalists also suffered from inhaling gas used by Israeli forces to disperse counter-demonstrators. At least two journalists were hospitalized as a result of their injuries. Meanwhile, marchers brought inflatable bouncy houses and other amusements to entertain children during the demonstration. \\u201cThousands of Israeli settlers marched through the northern West Bank today towards the Palestinian village of Beita flanked by Israeli regime forces. \\n\\nAmong them were dozens of Israeli regime ministers & lawmakers. \\n\\nMeanwhile Palestinians were tear gassed & their roads closed.\\u201d \u2014 Dr. Yara Hawari \\u062f. \\u064a\\u0627\\u0631\\u0627 \\u0647\\u0648\\u0627\\u0631\\u064a (@Dr. Yara Hawari \\u062f. \\u064a\\u0627\\u0631\\u0627 \\u0647\\u0648\\u0627\\u0631\\u064a) 1681137061 The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the march as \"a dangerous escalation and provocation of the Palestinian people and an extension of the incitement calls of the Israeli right and the fascist right to deepen settlement at the expense of land.\" Yumna Patel, Palestine news director at Mondoweiss, said on Twitter: \"The cognitive dissonance is truly astounding. Israeli settlers march on stolen land, in a settler colony that's given them the land to steal and colonize, alongside an army whose singular goal is to protect them. And yet, somehow, they are the victims in their own narrative.\"The liberal U.S. Jewish group J Street also condemned the march, tweeting that \"this is an incendiary and deeply dangerous act by some of the most senior ministers in the Israeli government.\"\"Their vision is clear: annexation, endless conflict, and chaos,\" the group added. \\u201cFar-right Israeli ministers join settler march for illegal Evyatar outpost\\n\\nIsraeli settlers marched near Nablus in the occupied West Bank to demand the re-establishment and legalisation of the evacuated illegal outpost of Evyatar (Avitar) near the Palestinian town of Beita\\u201d \u2014 Middle East Monitor (@Middle East Monitor) 1681207188 However, Ben-Gvir\u2014who is a settler\u2014asserted that \"we are here, and we are marching toward the future... I hope the entire state of Israel understands this.\"Smotrich told Haaretz while marching that \"God willing, we'll bring here another half-million Jews on top the half-million that are already here.\" United Nations experts say the true number of Israeli settlers colonizing the West Bank and East Jerusalem is closer to 700,000.Evyatar, an exclusively Jewish community first established in 2013, is built on stolen Palestinian land on Mount Sabih in Beita, south of Nablus. The settlement is illegal under both international and Israeli law and has been repeatedly destroyed by Israeli authorities. Since 1967, at least 77 Beita residents have been killed by Israeli forces, many of them during protests, according to Patel. \\u201cThe Palestinians in Beit have been protesting against the Evyatar outpost since 2021. At least 7 people, including 2 children, from the town have been killed over the course of the protests. We covered Beita's fight against the outpost back in 2021 https://t.co/Nw4aLS7LzD\\u201d \u2014 Yumna (@Yumna) 1681231625 The last mass eviction of Evyatar took place in June 2021. However, while the Israeli military says the outpost is \"flagrantly illegal,\" scores of homes have been built there with soldiers' help and the government has provided the community with electricity, water, and roads.On February 27\u2014the day after settlers' deadly rampage through the Palestinian town of Huwara\u2014Ben-Gvir, who leads the Jewish Power party, defiantly organized a rally in Evyatar, where he called for the assassination of \"terrorists\" who resist Israeli expansion.Netanyahu's government is seeking to \"legalize\" Evyatar as it did for nine other settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem earlier this year. When asked by Haaretz why Evyatar has not yet been legalized, Zvi Sukkot, an Israeli lawmaker representing the Religious Zionism party, said that \"legalizing such an outpost takes time.\"\"We're not afraid of America,\" he added. The Biden administration says it opposes settlement expansion, even while lavishing Israel with billions of dollars in annual military aid and diplomatic cover.",
