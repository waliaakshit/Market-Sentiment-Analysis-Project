                  "content": "Todd Groth Todd Groth is Head of Index Research at CoinDesk Indices. . He has over 10 years of experience involving systematic multi-asset risk premia and alternative investment strategies. Follow @ tgroth8 on Twitter It\u2019s been quite a start to the year in the world of crypto. Bitcoin ( BTC ) posted its best quarterly performance in over two years, gaining 68%, for the first three months of 2023. The broader CoinDesk Market Index, or CMI \u2013 which spans over 90% of the crypto market capitalization \u2013 is up 58% on the quarter with ether ( ETH ) and cardano ( ADA ) up 50% and 57% over the same period. Todd Groth is head of research at CoinDesk Indices , a provider of digital asset indices since 2014. The computing sector, or CPU (+67%), benefited from the positive sentiment surrounding artificial intelligence sparked by the the debut of ChatGPT last November. The currency sector, or CCY (+63%), benefited from the U.S. regional bank jitters and from the expansion across central bank balance sheets. January\u2019s rebound in investor sentiment (see \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d) has provided buoyancy for the broad market after a challenging 2022. Digitization, or BTZ (+24%), and DeFi, or DCF (+43%), are also positive for the year. Figure 1: CMI Sector 2023 Performance Attribution; Source: CDI Research Digital assets tend to do best when they trade according to their own narrative (say like bitcoin\u2019s inflation hedge thesis) and decouple from the factors and themes driving traditional asset classes. So far in 2023, crypto appears to be bucking trends driving stocks and bonds, including 2022 inflation fears and quantitative-tightening at the Federal Reserve. Digital assets have less in common now with growth-oriented equities, with a lowering of correlation between digital assets and equities. Within bitcoin specifically, we're also seeing a strengthening in the correlation with gold (positive) and the U.S. dollar (negative). The \u201cdigital gold\u201d and fiat \u201ccurrency debasement hedge\u201d narratives re-emerge and regain investor consideration. Figure 2: One-hour correlations between bitcoin (XBX) vs macro indexes. Source: CDI Research Bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed partly to the steepening of the yield curve in the bond market. We continue to see a moderately negative relationship between bitcoin price changes and the yield curve slope (using the five-year to the 30-year yield spread as proxies), which is a market-derived proxy for interest-rate expectations based on U.S. Treasury bond pricing. The recent peak in U.S. yield curve inversion of +46 basis points on March 8, just before the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, tumbled to -15 basis points as of March 27 as the market priced in fewer rate hikes and cuts post-SVB. This 60 basis-point drop in yield curve slope (with five-year rates dropping more than 30-year rates, bull steeping), combined with the negative correlation of -0.4 between the yield curve slope and bitcoin, suggests one-third of bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed to the steepening of the yield curve. This relationship between bitcoin and the yield curve strengthened during the Silicon Valley Bank event, supporting the digital gold narrative. With the Federal Reserve's balance sheet continuing to expand, in a mere two weeks the new lending facilities created to mitigate the regional banking crisis in March have undone months of balance sheet tightening. The Fed\u2019s actions come alongside continued monetary stimulus coming from the Bank of Japan (buying domestic bonds to maintain yield curve control) and the People\u2019s Bank of China, which is stimulating an economy weakened by COVID lockdowns. From the perspective of a digitally scarce asset like bitcoin, these are all encouraging developments. But it\u2019s unlikely we are heading for a halcyon redux of 2021\u2019s crypto bull market The U.S. regional banking concerns and the rapid unwind of Credit Suisse (CS) have highlighted weaknesses in the traditional financial system when interest rates rise. While this may come to the delight or amusement of crypto maximalists and critics of the fractionalized banking system, it is a source for further deleveraging contagion risk. Most digital-asset investments share a broader portfolio with traditional public and private-asset markets, with capital allocation decisions within these portfolios linking these disparate markets together through relative value choices which promote and drive correlations across markets. Crypto cannot sail alone. That the Fed will make fewer hikes, and more rate cuts, is pretty much priced into the market now and reflected in the yield curve steepening mentioned above. That has benefited bitcoin and gold, and at the expense of the U.S. dollar. A portion of these rate expectations might be due to the move of investors out of banking deposits and into front-end Treasurys for corporate treasury risk-management purposes. Why hold deposits at a regional bank, when you can earn similar interest in short-term paper without the credit risk of a potentially shaky bank? That said, the market appears to view the collapse of SVB as a pivot in the interest-rate hiking cycle. If the tightening of credit conditions and lending standards begin to percolate through the economy and inflation cools down further, then the Federal Reserve will no longer have to hike rates as the credit markets have effectively tightened financial conditions on the Fed\u2019s behalf. But if inflation remains persistent and elevated, the Fed will have to go against market pricing and continue to hike, which has the potential of triggering a redux of 2013's \"Taper Tantrum\" and the liquidation risk mentioned above. Liquidity in crypto markets has dropped with trading volumes post-FTX. Until prices rise enough to reignite interest from traders who exited the market in 2022, we don't expect it to improve. With U.S. regulatory action against exchanges and the closure of a number of banks providing crypto on-ramping services, additional hurdles remain for capital entering into the digital-asset market these days.

Follow @ jackschickler on Twitter A \"rough year\" for crypto markets has underlined the need for comprehensive and consistent regulation of the sector, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said, suggesting stablecoin issuers and crypto conglomerates need to have bank-style capital requirements. In its \"Global Financial Stability Report\" published Tuesday, the IMF joins the standard setters at the Financial Stability Board in calling for consistent international regulation of the cryptocurrency sector after a year that has seen a number of collapses of major exchanges and crypto-linked banks. \u201cThe collapse of multiple entities in the crypto asset ecosystem has again made the call more urgent for comprehensive and consistent regulation and adequate supervision\u201d focused on protecting consumers and corporate governance, the report said. The report added that regulations should cover crypto storage, transfer, exchange and custody of reserves, with extra prudential requirements for those carrying out multiple functions and for the issuers of stablecoins \u2013 tokens that seek to maintain their value versus fiat currencies. The report cites a \u201crough year for crypto,\u201d in which the collapse of crypto- and tech-heavy lenders Silvergate, Signature and Silicon Valley Banks followed from the bankruptcy of the FTX crypto exchange in November. \u201cThese events add to questions about the viability of digital assets and reinforce the need for appropriate regulation,\u201d the IMF said. The IMF\u2019s report followed a warning issued earlier Tuesday by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) that financial authorities need to be able to monitor crypto leverage, decentralized finance and crypto staking and lending. \"Crypto-assets have experienced exponential growth in recent years, and the future development path of this market is uncertain,\u201d said a statement by the ESRB, a watchdog agency chaired by the European Central Bank\u2019s Christine Lagarde. The Financial Stability Board, a grouping of international regulators, is due to issue its own crypto rules in July, and its head, Klaas Knot, has already said many existing stablecoins would be unlikely to meet its strictures . Many traditional finance players want to see curbs on crypto conglomerates because the mixing of different financial functions could lead to conflicts of interest , despite concerns about constraining innovation. The IMF\u2019s Executive Board has previously expressed concerns over the potential of crypto to usurp the role of legal tender , though it stopped short of calling for an outright ban on digital assets.

                  "content": "Sam Reynolds Follow @ thesamreynolds on Twitter Bankruptcy claims trading market Xclaim has closed a $7 million Series A funding round, the company said Tuesday. Xclaim allows for the trading of major bankruptcy creditor claims, including FTX, CoinDesk sister company Genesis and BlockFi. Currently, FTX claims are going for 19 cents on the dollar, up from 13 cents earlier this year , while Genesis is going for 52.5 cents and BlockFi for 18 cents. \u201cTo further enhance liquidity, we intend to use the capital from our recent fundraise to expand our products and service offerings. We are most excited about our innovation of Collateralized Claim Obligations,\u201d founder and CEO Matthew Sedigh, said in a note. \u201cBy aggregating diversified pools of thousands of claims under a single umbrella, we will have created commoditized products from bespoke assets. This will dramatically open up the market to many more participants on both sides of the market.\u201d Xclaim says it has listed more than $1 billion of claims and traded more than $200 million in volume since it started operations in 2018, with 500 registered investors \u2013 typically individuals or firms experienced with bankruptcy claims purchasing \u2013 on the platform. Single claims as large as $52 million have traded on the exchange, Xclaim says. Xclaim isn\u2019t the only platform offering bankruptcy claims trading. Recently Three Arrows Capital co-founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu launched OPNX, which is short for Open Exchange. OPNX has struggled to obtain momentum, however, with CoinGecko reporting that the exchange only has $179,235 in volume. In an earlier interview with CoinDesk , Xclaim Chief Strategy Officer Andrew Glantz said the majority of interest is from Asia-based sellers of claims. Glantz said 50% of participants come from Singapore, 15% from China and 23% from Taiwan. Taiwan experienced significant per-capita losses on FTX, owing to the strong interest of Taiwanese individuals in the platform's attractive returns on U.S. dollar deposits. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

Follow @ egreechee on Twitter Crypto miner CleanSpark (CLSK) bought 45,000 new Bitmain Antminer S19 XPs for $144.9 million, which will almost double its current computing power, or hashrate, once installed, the firm said in a Tuesday press release. This is the latest in a series of acquisition of distressed assets by the miner, which started in the summer of 2022. The 45,000 Antminers will add over 6.3 exahash/second (EH/s) of computing power to CleanSpark's fleet of 6.7 EH/s, once delivered and installed. The acquisition announcement comes as bitcoin crossed $30,000 for the first time in nearly a year, which could reinvigorate the bitcoin mining space. The first batch of 25,000 rigs will be ready for delivery in August from Bitmain, and the rest are scheduled for September. They will be installed at a site in Sandersville, Georgia, which CleanSpark acquired from Mawson Infrastructure (MIGI) in September. CleanSpark aims to have 16 EH/s of computing power by the end of the year. It lowered its 2023 guidance in December 2022 from 22.4 EH/s, citing delays in construction by one of its partners, Lancium. Another 2.44 EH/s of machines that it acquired at a discount in February are expected to be online at a Washington state facility later in Q2. \"As bitcoin\u2019s halving draws closer, our focus on operational efficiency, our technical expertise, and our treasury management strategy, will all play a crucial role in solidifying CleanSpark\u2019s position among the top bitcoin mining companies in America,\" said Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark.

Follow @ BrandyBetz on Twitter Noted venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has released its second annual \"State of Crypto\" report highlighting the importance of Web3, blockchain infrastructure and a price-innovation cycle that makes the bear market a prime time for builders. The firm also unveiled on Tuesday its new State of Crypto Index , an interactive tool that tracks on a monthly basis 14 technology-focused metrics that offer a health snapshot of sorts for the industry. \u201cOur 2023 report aims to address the imbalance between the noise of fleeting price movements \u2013 and the data that tracks the signals that matter, including the durable progress of Web3 technology. Overall, the report reflects a healthier industry than market prices may indicate, and a steady cycle of development, product launches, and ongoing innovation,\u201d wrote a16z\u2019s Daren Matsuoka, Eddy Lazzarin, Robert Hackett and Stephanie Zinn in a blog post . The report says that the headline-grabbing scandals and collapses of the past year have demonstrated the failure of centralized systems versus the open, resilient nature of decentralized infrastructure. A16z notes that Web3 is \u201cmore than a financial movement, it\u2019s an evolution of the internet\u201d and it advances the internet through \u201ccrypto computers, not crypto casinos.\u201d A16z notes the advantages of Web3 over prior technological models include decentralized blockchain networks, the community-governed nature, the lack of power consolidation among corporations and value occurring to network participants. Web3 adoption is still in its early stages, and decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) metrics have become more stable after falling from record highs in 2021, according to the report. Gaming has shown particular strength: 700 Web3 games launched last year, and games now generate 23 times more on-chain transactions than DeFi. Last month in the broader crypto industry, there were more than 15 million active addresses, the highest number the firm has ever tracked and more than twice as much as seen in March 2021. The price-innovation cycle says that market downturns bring more dedicated developers into the crypto space and then the excitement around those projects eventually begins to drive asset prices higher. \u201cProduct cycles are where new things that lead to consistent and more robust growth over many years are occurring, regardless of financial cycles,\u201d A16z Chief Technology Officer Eddy Lazzarin told CoinDesk during an interview. A16z highlighted the ongoing improvements in blockchain infrastructure. Key factors include new layer 1 chains that improve scalability and programmability and layer 2 scaling systems, such as optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups. The firm is particularly positive on zero-knowledge proofs, a method of computationally verifying that a transaction is valid.

The call for attorneys to join the regulator's Crypto Asset and Cyber Unit, or CACU, comes after the agency said in March that it was \"planning to add additional staff\" to the unit , which was initially meant to be a 20-person operation but has since doubled in size. Under Chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC has been cracking down on the crypto industry with renewed vigor since the 2022 market turmoil saw the collapse of big firms in the sector, crypto exchange FTX among them. The attorneys joining the CACU are expected to conduct investigations involving \"crypto asset securities,\" develop litigation plans, draft legal documents including subpoenas and conduct depositions. The CACU \"exercises the full range of the Division's investigative and law enforcement powers, and focuses on violations of the federal securities laws,\" the job posting said. Compensation for the positions range between $140,000 and $260,000 depending on the location. Applications for the positions close on April 17, according to the posting.

He has over 10 years of experience involving systematic multi-asset risk premia and alternative investment strategies. Follow @ tgroth8 on Twitter It\u2019s been quite a start to the year in the world of crypto. Bitcoin ( BTC ) posted its best quarterly performance in over two years, gaining 68%, for the first three months of 2023. The broader CoinDesk Market Index, or CMI \u2013 which spans over 90% of the crypto market capitalization \u2013 is up 58% on the quarter with ether ( ETH ) and cardano ( ADA ) up 50% and 57% over the same period. Todd Groth is head of research at CoinDesk Indices , a provider of digital asset indices since 2014. The computing sector, or CPU (+67%), benefited from the positive sentiment surrounding artificial intelligence sparked by the the debut of ChatGPT last November. The currency sector, or CCY (+63%), benefited from the U.S. regional bank jitters and from the expansion across central bank balance sheets. January\u2019s rebound in investor sentiment (see \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d) has provided buoyancy for the broad market after a challenging 2022. Digitization, or BTZ (+24%), and DeFi, or DCF (+43%), are also positive for the year. Figure 1: CMI Sector 2023 Performance Attribution; Source: CDI Research Digital assets tend to do best when they trade according to their own narrative (say like bitcoin\u2019s inflation hedge thesis) and decouple from the factors and themes driving traditional asset classes. So far in 2023, crypto appears to be bucking trends driving stocks and bonds, including 2022 inflation fears and quantitative-tightening at the Federal Reserve. Digital assets have less in common now with growth-oriented equities, with a lowering of correlation between digital assets and equities. Within bitcoin specifically, we're also seeing a strengthening in the correlation with gold (positive) and the U.S. dollar (negative). The \u201cdigital gold\u201d and fiat \u201ccurrency debasement hedge\u201d narratives re-emerge and regain investor consideration. Figure 2: One-hour correlations between bitcoin (XBX) vs macro indexes. Source: CDI Research Bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed partly to the steepening of the yield curve in the bond market. We continue to see a moderately negative relationship between bitcoin price changes and the yield curve slope (using the five-year to the 30-year yield spread as proxies), which is a market-derived proxy for interest-rate expectations based on U.S. Treasury bond pricing. The recent peak in U.S. yield curve inversion of +46 basis points on March 8, just before the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, tumbled to -15 basis points as of March 27 as the market priced in fewer rate hikes and cuts post-SVB. This 60 basis-point drop in yield curve slope (with five-year rates dropping more than 30-year rates, bull steeping), combined with the negative correlation of -0.4 between the yield curve slope and bitcoin, suggests one-third of bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed to the steepening of the yield curve. This relationship between bitcoin and the yield curve strengthened during the Silicon Valley Bank event, supporting the digital gold narrative. With the Federal Reserve's balance sheet continuing to expand, in a mere two weeks the new lending facilities created to mitigate the regional banking crisis in March have undone months of balance sheet tightening. The Fed\u2019s actions come alongside continued monetary stimulus coming from the Bank of Japan (buying domestic bonds to maintain yield curve control) and the People\u2019s Bank of China, which is stimulating an economy weakened by COVID lockdowns. From the perspective of a digitally scarce asset like bitcoin, these are all encouraging developments. But it\u2019s unlikely we are heading for a halcyon redux of 2021\u2019s crypto bull market The U.S. regional banking concerns and the rapid unwind of Credit Suisse (CS) have highlighted weaknesses in the traditional financial system when interest rates rise. While this may come to the delight or amusement of crypto maximalists and critics of the fractionalized banking system, it is a source for further deleveraging contagion risk. Most digital-asset investments share a broader portfolio with traditional public and private-asset markets, with capital allocation decisions within these portfolios linking these disparate markets together through relative value choices which promote and drive correlations across markets. Crypto cannot sail alone. That the Fed will make fewer hikes, and more rate cuts, is pretty much priced into the market now and reflected in the yield curve steepening mentioned above. That has benefited bitcoin and gold, and at the expense of the U.S. dollar. A portion of these rate expectations might be due to the move of investors out of banking deposits and into front-end Treasurys for corporate treasury risk-management purposes. Why hold deposits at a regional bank, when you can earn similar interest in short-term paper without the credit risk of a potentially shaky bank? That said, the market appears to view the collapse of SVB as a pivot in the interest-rate hiking cycle. If the tightening of credit conditions and lending standards begin to percolate through the economy and inflation cools down further, then the Federal Reserve will no longer have to hike rates as the credit markets have effectively tightened financial conditions on the Fed\u2019s behalf. But if inflation remains persistent and elevated, the Fed will have to go against market pricing and continue to hike, which has the potential of triggering a redux of 2013's \"Taper Tantrum\" and the liquidation risk mentioned above. Liquidity in crypto markets has dropped with trading volumes post-FTX. Until prices rise enough to reignite interest from traders who exited the market in 2022, we don't expect it to improve. With U.S. regulatory action against exchanges and the closure of a number of banks providing crypto on-ramping services, additional hurdles remain for capital entering into the digital-asset market these days.

Follow @ jackschickler on Twitter A \"rough year\" for crypto markets has underlined the need for comprehensive and consistent regulation of the sector, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said, suggesting stablecoin issuers and crypto conglomerates need to have bank-style capital requirements. In its \"Global Financial Stability Report\" published Tuesday, the IMF joins the standard setters at the Financial Stability Board in calling for consistent international regulation of the cryptocurrency sector after a year that has seen a number of collapses of major exchanges and crypto-linked banks. \u201cThe collapse of multiple entities in the crypto asset ecosystem has again made the call more urgent for comprehensive and consistent regulation and adequate supervision\u201d focused on protecting consumers and corporate governance, the report said. The report added that regulations should cover crypto storage, transfer, exchange and custody of reserves, with extra prudential requirements for those carrying out multiple functions and for the issuers of stablecoins \u2013 tokens that seek to maintain their value versus fiat currencies. The report cites a \u201crough year for crypto,\u201d in which the collapse of crypto- and tech-heavy lenders Silvergate, Signature and Silicon Valley Banks followed from the bankruptcy of the FTX crypto exchange in November. \u201cThese events add to questions about the viability of digital assets and reinforce the need for appropriate regulation,\u201d the IMF said. The IMF\u2019s report followed a warning issued earlier Tuesday by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) that financial authorities need to be able to monitor crypto leverage, decentralized finance and crypto staking and lending. \"Crypto-assets have experienced exponential growth in recent years, and the future development path of this market is uncertain,\u201d said a statement by the ESRB, a watchdog agency chaired by the European Central Bank\u2019s Christine Lagarde. The Financial Stability Board, a grouping of international regulators, is due to issue its own crypto rules in July, and its head, Klaas Knot, has already said many existing stablecoins would be unlikely to meet its strictures . Many traditional finance players want to see curbs on crypto conglomerates because the mixing of different financial functions could lead to conflicts of interest , despite concerns about constraining innovation. The IMF\u2019s Executive Board has previously expressed concerns over the potential of crypto to usurp the role of legal tender , though it stopped short of calling for an outright ban on digital assets.

The protocol's latest investment follows its unveiling of RSS3 AIOP, an AI training environment providing Web3 information to the likes of ChatGPT. Traders have been betting on the potential of artificial intelligence and crypto, following the recent rise in popularity of AI-driven chatbots such as ChatGPT and image generation software DALL-E. While these do not actually use blockchain technology or cryptocurrency, crypto traders have nonetheless been drawn to AI-focused tokens as the next big growth area. \"We believe RSS3 is perfectly positioned to empower developers to create diverse, cutting-edge applications that will redefine how we interact with the web3 ecosystem,\" DWF Labs' managing partner Andrei Grachev said. RSS3's token has a market cap of just under $60 million at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap data .

Follow @ egreechee on Twitter Crypto miner CleanSpark (CLSK) bought 45,000 new Bitmain Antminer S19 XPs for $144.9 million, which will almost double its current computing power, or hashrate, once installed, the firm said in a Tuesday press release. This is the latest in a series of acquisition of distressed assets by the miner, which started in the summer of 2022. The 45,000 Antminers will add over 6.3 exahash/second (EH/s) of computing power to CleanSpark's fleet of 6.7 EH/s, once delivered and installed. The acquisition announcement comes as bitcoin crossed $30,000 for the first time in nearly a year, which could reinvigorate the bitcoin mining space. The first batch of 25,000 rigs will be ready for delivery in August from Bitmain, and the rest are scheduled for September. They will be installed at a site in Sandersville, Georgia, which CleanSpark acquired from Mawson Infrastructure (MIGI) in September. CleanSpark aims to have 16 EH/s of computing power by the end of the year. It lowered its 2023 guidance in December 2022 from 22.4 EH/s, citing delays in construction by one of its partners, Lancium. Another 2.44 EH/s of machines that it acquired at a discount in February are expected to be online at a Washington state facility later in Q2. \"As bitcoin\u2019s halving draws closer, our focus on operational efficiency, our technical expertise, and our treasury management strategy, will all play a crucial role in solidifying CleanSpark\u2019s position among the top bitcoin mining companies in America,\" said Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark.

Follow @ BrandyBetz on Twitter Noted venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has released its second annual \"State of Crypto\" report highlighting the importance of Web3, blockchain infrastructure and a price-innovation cycle that makes the bear market a prime time for builders. The firm also unveiled on Tuesday its new State of Crypto Index , an interactive tool that tracks on a monthly basis 14 technology-focused metrics that offer a health snapshot of sorts for the industry. \u201cOur 2023 report aims to address the imbalance between the noise of fleeting price movements \u2013 and the data that tracks the signals that matter, including the durable progress of Web3 technology. Overall, the report reflects a healthier industry than market prices may indicate, and a steady cycle of development, product launches, and ongoing innovation,\u201d wrote a16z\u2019s Daren Matsuoka, Eddy Lazzarin, Robert Hackett and Stephanie Zinn in a blog post . The report says that the headline-grabbing scandals and collapses of the past year have demonstrated the failure of centralized systems versus the open, resilient nature of decentralized infrastructure. A16z notes that Web3 is \u201cmore than a financial movement, it\u2019s an evolution of the internet\u201d and it advances the internet through \u201ccrypto computers, not crypto casinos.\u201d A16z notes the advantages of Web3 over prior technological models include decentralized blockchain networks, the community-governed nature, the lack of power consolidation among corporations and value occurring to network participants. Web3 adoption is still in its early stages, and decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) metrics have become more stable after falling from record highs in 2021, according to the report. Gaming has shown particular strength: 700 Web3 games launched last year, and games now generate 23 times more on-chain transactions than DeFi. Last month in the broader crypto industry, there were more than 15 million active addresses, the highest number the firm has ever tracked and more than twice as much as seen in March 2021. The price-innovation cycle says that market downturns bring more dedicated developers into the crypto space and then the excitement around those projects eventually begins to drive asset prices higher. \u201cProduct cycles are where new things that lead to consistent and more robust growth over many years are occurring, regardless of financial cycles,\u201d A16z Chief Technology Officer Eddy Lazzarin told CoinDesk during an interview. A16z highlighted the ongoing improvements in blockchain infrastructure. Key factors include new layer 1 chains that improve scalability and programmability and layer 2 scaling systems, such as optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups. The firm is particularly positive on zero-knowledge proofs, a method of computationally verifying that a transaction is valid.

The call for attorneys to join the regulator's Crypto Asset and Cyber Unit, or CACU, comes after the agency said in March that it was \"planning to add additional staff\" to the unit , which was initially meant to be a 20-person operation but has since doubled in size. Under Chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC has been cracking down on the crypto industry with renewed vigor since the 2022 market turmoil saw the collapse of big firms in the sector, crypto exchange FTX among them. The attorneys joining the CACU are expected to conduct investigations involving \"crypto asset securities,\" develop litigation plans, draft legal documents including subpoenas and conduct depositions. The CACU \"exercises the full range of the Division's investigative and law enforcement powers, and focuses on violations of the federal securities laws,\" the job posting said. Compensation for the positions range between $140,000 and $260,000 depending on the location. Applications for the positions close on April 17, according to the posting.

He has over 10 years of experience involving systematic multi-asset risk premia and alternative investment strategies. Follow @ tgroth8 on Twitter It\u2019s been quite a start to the year in the world of crypto. Bitcoin ( BTC ) posted its best quarterly performance in over two years, gaining 68%, for the first three months of 2023. The broader CoinDesk Market Index, or CMI \u2013 which spans over 90% of the crypto market capitalization \u2013 is up 58% on the quarter with ether ( ETH ) and cardano ( ADA ) up 50% and 57% over the same period. Todd Groth is head of research at CoinDesk Indices , a provider of digital asset indices since 2014. The computing sector, or CPU (+67%), benefited from the positive sentiment surrounding artificial intelligence sparked by the the debut of ChatGPT last November. The currency sector, or CCY (+63%), benefited from the U.S. regional bank jitters and from the expansion across central bank balance sheets. January\u2019s rebound in investor sentiment (see \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d) has provided buoyancy for the broad market after a challenging 2022. Digitization, or BTZ (+24%), and DeFi, or DCF (+43%), are also positive for the year. Figure 1: CMI Sector 2023 Performance Attribution; Source: CDI Research Digital assets tend to do best when they trade according to their own narrative (say like bitcoin\u2019s inflation hedge thesis) and decouple from the factors and themes driving traditional asset classes. So far in 2023, crypto appears to be bucking trends driving stocks and bonds, including 2022 inflation fears and quantitative-tightening at the Federal Reserve. Digital assets have less in common now with growth-oriented equities, with a lowering of correlation between digital assets and equities. Within bitcoin specifically, we're also seeing a strengthening in the correlation with gold (positive) and the U.S. dollar (negative). The \u201cdigital gold\u201d and fiat \u201ccurrency debasement hedge\u201d narratives re-emerge and regain investor consideration. Figure 2: One-hour correlations between bitcoin (XBX) vs macro indexes. Source: CDI Research Bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed partly to the steepening of the yield curve in the bond market. We continue to see a moderately negative relationship between bitcoin price changes and the yield curve slope (using the five-year to the 30-year yield spread as proxies), which is a market-derived proxy for interest-rate expectations based on U.S. Treasury bond pricing. The recent peak in U.S. yield curve inversion of +46 basis points on March 8, just before the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, tumbled to -15 basis points as of March 27 as the market priced in fewer rate hikes and cuts post-SVB. This 60 basis-point drop in yield curve slope (with five-year rates dropping more than 30-year rates, bull steeping), combined with the negative correlation of -0.4 between the yield curve slope and bitcoin, suggests one-third of bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed to the steepening of the yield curve. This relationship between bitcoin and the yield curve strengthened during the Silicon Valley Bank event, supporting the digital gold narrative. With the Federal Reserve's balance sheet continuing to expand, in a mere two weeks the new lending facilities created to mitigate the regional banking crisis in March have undone months of balance sheet tightening. The Fed\u2019s actions come alongside continued monetary stimulus coming from the Bank of Japan (buying domestic bonds to maintain yield curve control) and the People\u2019s Bank of China, which is stimulating an economy weakened by COVID lockdowns. From the perspective of a digitally scarce asset like bitcoin, these are all encouraging developments. But it\u2019s unlikely we are heading for a halcyon redux of 2021\u2019s crypto bull market The U.S. regional banking concerns and the rapid unwind of Credit Suisse (CS) have highlighted weaknesses in the traditional financial system when interest rates rise. While this may come to the delight or amusement of crypto maximalists and critics of the fractionalized banking system, it is a source for further deleveraging contagion risk. Most digital-asset investments share a broader portfolio with traditional public and private-asset markets, with capital allocation decisions within these portfolios linking these disparate markets together through relative value choices which promote and drive correlations across markets. Crypto cannot sail alone. That the Fed will make fewer hikes, and more rate cuts, is pretty much priced into the market now and reflected in the yield curve steepening mentioned above. That has benefited bitcoin and gold, and at the expense of the U.S. dollar. A portion of these rate expectations might be due to the move of investors out of banking deposits and into front-end Treasurys for corporate treasury risk-management purposes. Why hold deposits at a regional bank, when you can earn similar interest in short-term paper without the credit risk of a potentially shaky bank? That said, the market appears to view the collapse of SVB as a pivot in the interest-rate hiking cycle. If the tightening of credit conditions and lending standards begin to percolate through the economy and inflation cools down further, then the Federal Reserve will no longer have to hike rates as the credit markets have effectively tightened financial conditions on the Fed\u2019s behalf. But if inflation remains persistent and elevated, the Fed will have to go against market pricing and continue to hike, which has the potential of triggering a redux of 2013's \"Taper Tantrum\" and the liquidation risk mentioned above. Liquidity in crypto markets has dropped with trading volumes post-FTX. Until prices rise enough to reignite interest from traders who exited the market in 2022, we don't expect it to improve. With U.S. regulatory action against exchanges and the closure of a number of banks providing crypto on-ramping services, additional hurdles remain for capital entering into the digital-asset market these days.

Follow @ jackschickler on Twitter A \"rough year\" for crypto markets has underlined the need for comprehensive and consistent regulation of the sector, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said, suggesting stablecoin issuers and crypto conglomerates need to have bank-style capital requirements. In its \"Global Financial Stability Report\" published Tuesday, the IMF joins the standard setters at the Financial Stability Board in calling for consistent international regulation of the cryptocurrency sector after a year that has seen a number of collapses of major exchanges and crypto-linked banks. \u201cThe collapse of multiple entities in the crypto asset ecosystem has again made the call more urgent for comprehensive and consistent regulation and adequate supervision\u201d focused on protecting consumers and corporate governance, the report said. The report added that regulations should cover crypto storage, transfer, exchange and custody of reserves, with extra prudential requirements for those carrying out multiple functions and for the issuers of stablecoins \u2013 tokens that seek to maintain their value versus fiat currencies. The report cites a \u201crough year for crypto,\u201d in which the collapse of crypto- and tech-heavy lenders Silvergate, Signature and Silicon Valley Banks followed from the bankruptcy of the FTX crypto exchange in November. \u201cThese events add to questions about the viability of digital assets and reinforce the need for appropriate regulation,\u201d the IMF said. The IMF\u2019s report followed a warning issued earlier Tuesday by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) that financial authorities need to be able to monitor crypto leverage, decentralized finance and crypto staking and lending. \"Crypto-assets have experienced exponential growth in recent years, and the future development path of this market is uncertain,\u201d said a statement by the ESRB, a watchdog agency chaired by the European Central Bank\u2019s Christine Lagarde. The Financial Stability Board, a grouping of international regulators, is due to issue its own crypto rules in July, and its head, Klaas Knot, has already said many existing stablecoins would be unlikely to meet its strictures . Many traditional finance players want to see curbs on crypto conglomerates because the mixing of different financial functions could lead to conflicts of interest , despite concerns about constraining innovation. The IMF\u2019s Executive Board has previously expressed concerns over the potential of crypto to usurp the role of legal tender , though it stopped short of calling for an outright ban on digital assets.

Developers said they expect to add fiat-to-crypto on-ramps, a dapp store, in-wallet swaps and staking enchantments in future releases. Wallet services such as Lace may allow users to easily access decentralized-finance tools and be incentivized for using services on any blockchain, which may boost the token ecosystem for that network as it attracts traders hunting for opportunities that may have worn off on other networks.

RSS3 aims to be a bridge between blockchain technology and AI, search engines and social media. It has previously attracted investment from Coinbase, Dragonfly and noted entrepreneur and former Andreessen Horowitz partner Balaji Srinivasan. The protocol's latest investment follows its unveiling of RSS3 AIOP, an AI training environment providing Web3 information to the likes of ChatGPT. Traders have been betting on the potential of artificial intelligence and crypto, following the recent rise in popularity of AI-driven chatbots such as ChatGPT and image generation software DALL-E. While these do not actually use blockchain technology or cryptocurrency, crypto traders have nonetheless been drawn to AI-focused tokens as the next big growth area. \"We believe RSS3 is perfectly positioned to empower developers to create diverse, cutting-edge applications that will redefine how we interact with the web3 ecosystem,\" DWF Labs' managing partner Andrei Grachev said. RSS3's token has a market cap of just under $60 million at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap data . The $10 million purchase by DWF Labs is the firm's tenth investment of at least $10 million into crypto and Web3 projects in less than two months.

Currently, FTX claims are going for 19 cents on the dollar, up from 13 cents earlier this year , while Genesis is going for 52.5 cents and BlockFi for 18 cents. \u201cTo further enhance liquidity, we intend to use the capital from our recent fundraise to expand our products and service offerings. We are most excited about our innovation of Collateralized Claim Obligations,\u201d founder and CEO Matthew Sedigh, said in a note. \u201cBy aggregating diversified pools of thousands of claims under a single umbrella, we will have created commoditized products from bespoke assets. This will dramatically open up the market to many more participants on both sides of the market.\u201d Xclaim says it has listed more than $1 billion of claims and traded more than $200 million in volume since it started operations in 2018, with 500 registered investors \u2013 typically individuals or firms experienced with bankruptcy claims purchasing \u2013 on the platform. Single claims as large as $52 million have traded on the exchange, Xclaim says. Xclaim isn\u2019t the only platform offering bankruptcy claims trading.

OPNX has struggled to obtain momentum, however, with CoinGecko reporting that the exchange only has $179,235 in volume. In an earlier interview with CoinDesk , Xclaim Chief Strategy Officer Andrew Glantz said the majority of interest is from Asia-based sellers of claims. Glantz said 50% of participants come from Singapore, 15% from China and 23% from Taiwan. Taiwan experienced significant per-capita losses on FTX, owing to the strong interest of Taiwanese individuals in the platform's attractive returns on U.S. dollar deposits. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

Follow @ egreechee on Twitter Crypto miner CleanSpark (CLSK) bought 45,000 new Bitmain Antminer S19 XPs for $144.9 million, which will almost double its current computing power, or hashrate, once installed, the firm said in a Tuesday press release. This is the latest in a series of acquisition of distressed assets by the miner, which started in the summer of 2022. The 45,000 Antminers will add over 6.3 exahash/second (EH/s) of computing power to CleanSpark's fleet of 6.7 EH/s, once delivered and installed. The acquisition announcement comes as bitcoin crossed $30,000 for the first time in nearly a year, which could reinvigorate the bitcoin mining space. The first batch of 25,000 rigs will be ready for delivery in August from Bitmain, and the rest are scheduled for September. They will be installed at a site in Sandersville, Georgia, which CleanSpark acquired from Mawson Infrastructure (MIGI) in September. CleanSpark aims to have 16 EH/s of computing power by the end of the year. It lowered its 2023 guidance in December 2022 from 22.4 EH/s, citing delays in construction by one of its partners, Lancium. Another 2.44 EH/s of machines that it acquired at a discount in February are expected to be online at a Washington state facility later in Q2. \"As bitcoin\u2019s halving draws closer, our focus on operational efficiency, our technical expertise, and our treasury management strategy, will all play a crucial role in solidifying CleanSpark\u2019s position among the top bitcoin mining companies in America,\" said Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark.

Follow @ BrandyBetz on Twitter Noted venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has released its second annual \"State of Crypto\" report highlighting the importance of Web3, blockchain infrastructure and a price-innovation cycle that makes the bear market a prime time for builders. The firm also unveiled on Tuesday its new State of Crypto Index , an interactive tool that tracks on a monthly basis 14 technology-focused metrics that offer a health snapshot of sorts for the industry. \u201cOur 2023 report aims to address the imbalance between the noise of fleeting price movements \u2013 and the data that tracks the signals that matter, including the durable progress of Web3 technology. Overall, the report reflects a healthier industry than market prices may indicate, and a steady cycle of development, product launches, and ongoing innovation,\u201d wrote a16z\u2019s Daren Matsuoka, Eddy Lazzarin, Robert Hackett and Stephanie Zinn in a blog post . The report says that the headline-grabbing scandals and collapses of the past year have demonstrated the failure of centralized systems versus the open, resilient nature of decentralized infrastructure. A16z notes that Web3 is \u201cmore than a financial movement, it\u2019s an evolution of the internet\u201d and it advances the internet through \u201ccrypto computers, not crypto casinos.\u201d A16z notes the advantages of Web3 over prior technological models include decentralized blockchain networks, the community-governed nature, the lack of power consolidation among corporations and value occurring to network participants. Web3 adoption is still in its early stages, and decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) metrics have become more stable after falling from record highs in 2021, according to the report. Gaming has shown particular strength: 700 Web3 games launched last year, and games now generate 23 times more on-chain transactions than DeFi. Last month in the broader crypto industry, there were more than 15 million active addresses, the highest number the firm has ever tracked and more than twice as much as seen in March 2021. The price-innovation cycle says that market downturns bring more dedicated developers into the crypto space and then the excitement around those projects eventually begins to drive asset prices higher. \u201cProduct cycles are where new things that lead to consistent and more robust growth over many years are occurring, regardless of financial cycles,\u201d A16z Chief Technology Officer Eddy Lazzarin told CoinDesk during an interview. A16z highlighted the ongoing improvements in blockchain infrastructure. Key factors include new layer 1 chains that improve scalability and programmability and layer 2 scaling systems, such as optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups. The firm is particularly positive on zero-knowledge proofs, a method of computationally verifying that a transaction is valid.

The call for attorneys to join the regulator's Crypto Asset and Cyber Unit, or CACU, comes after the agency said in March that it was \"planning to add additional staff\" to the unit , which was initially meant to be a 20-person operation but has since doubled in size. Under Chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC has been cracking down on the crypto industry with renewed vigor since the 2022 market turmoil saw the collapse of big firms in the sector, crypto exchange FTX among them. The attorneys joining the CACU are expected to conduct investigations involving \"crypto asset securities,\" develop litigation plans, draft legal documents including subpoenas and conduct depositions. The CACU \"exercises the full range of the Division's investigative and law enforcement powers, and focuses on violations of the federal securities laws,\" the job posting said. Compensation for the positions range between $140,000 and $260,000 depending on the location. Applications for the positions close on April 17, according to the posting.

He has over 10 years of experience involving systematic multi-asset risk premia and alternative investment strategies. Follow @ tgroth8 on Twitter It\u2019s been quite a start to the year in the world of crypto. Bitcoin ( BTC ) posted its best quarterly performance in over two years, gaining 68%, for the first three months of 2023. The broader CoinDesk Market Index, or CMI \u2013 which spans over 90% of the crypto market capitalization \u2013 is up 58% on the quarter with ether ( ETH ) and cardano ( ADA ) up 50% and 57% over the same period. Todd Groth is head of research at CoinDesk Indices , a provider of digital asset indices since 2014. The computing sector, or CPU (+67%), benefited from the positive sentiment surrounding artificial intelligence sparked by the the debut of ChatGPT last November. The currency sector, or CCY (+63%), benefited from the U.S. regional bank jitters and from the expansion across central bank balance sheets. January\u2019s rebound in investor sentiment (see \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d) has provided buoyancy for the broad market after a challenging 2022. Digitization, or BTZ (+24%), and DeFi, or DCF (+43%), are also positive for the year. Figure 1: CMI Sector 2023 Performance Attribution; Source: CDI Research Digital assets tend to do best when they trade according to their own narrative (say like bitcoin\u2019s inflation hedge thesis) and decouple from the factors and themes driving traditional asset classes. So far in 2023, crypto appears to be bucking trends driving stocks and bonds, including 2022 inflation fears and quantitative-tightening at the Federal Reserve. Digital assets have less in common now with growth-oriented equities, with a lowering of correlation between digital assets and equities. Within bitcoin specifically, we're also seeing a strengthening in the correlation with gold (positive) and the U.S. dollar (negative). The \u201cdigital gold\u201d and fiat \u201ccurrency debasement hedge\u201d narratives re-emerge and regain investor consideration. Figure 2: One-hour correlations between bitcoin (XBX) vs macro indexes. Source: CDI Research Bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed partly to the steepening of the yield curve in the bond market. We continue to see a moderately negative relationship between bitcoin price changes and the yield curve slope (using the five-year to the 30-year yield spread as proxies), which is a market-derived proxy for interest-rate expectations based on U.S. Treasury bond pricing. The recent peak in U.S. yield curve inversion of +46 basis points on March 8, just before the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, tumbled to -15 basis points as of March 27 as the market priced in fewer rate hikes and cuts post-SVB. This 60 basis-point drop in yield curve slope (with five-year rates dropping more than 30-year rates, bull steeping), combined with the negative correlation of -0.4 between the yield curve slope and bitcoin, suggests one-third of bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed to the steepening of the yield curve. This relationship between bitcoin and the yield curve strengthened during the Silicon Valley Bank event, supporting the digital gold narrative. With the Federal Reserve's balance sheet continuing to expand, in a mere two weeks the new lending facilities created to mitigate the regional banking crisis in March have undone months of balance sheet tightening. The Fed\u2019s actions come alongside continued monetary stimulus coming from the Bank of Japan (buying domestic bonds to maintain yield curve control) and the People\u2019s Bank of China, which is stimulating an economy weakened by COVID lockdowns. From the perspective of a digitally scarce asset like bitcoin, these are all encouraging developments. But it\u2019s unlikely we are heading for a halcyon redux of 2021\u2019s crypto bull market The U.S. regional banking concerns and the rapid unwind of Credit Suisse (CS) have highlighted weaknesses in the traditional financial system when interest rates rise. While this may come to the delight or amusement of crypto maximalists and critics of the fractionalized banking system, it is a source for further deleveraging contagion risk. Most digital-asset investments share a broader portfolio with traditional public and private-asset markets, with capital allocation decisions within these portfolios linking these disparate markets together through relative value choices which promote and drive correlations across markets. Crypto cannot sail alone. That the Fed will make fewer hikes, and more rate cuts, is pretty much priced into the market now and reflected in the yield curve steepening mentioned above. That has benefited bitcoin and gold, and at the expense of the U.S. dollar. A portion of these rate expectations might be due to the move of investors out of banking deposits and into front-end Treasurys for corporate treasury risk-management purposes. Why hold deposits at a regional bank, when you can earn similar interest in short-term paper without the credit risk of a potentially shaky bank? That said, the market appears to view the collapse of SVB as a pivot in the interest-rate hiking cycle. If the tightening of credit conditions and lending standards begin to percolate through the economy and inflation cools down further, then the Federal Reserve will no longer have to hike rates as the credit markets have effectively tightened financial conditions on the Fed\u2019s behalf. But if inflation remains persistent and elevated, the Fed will have to go against market pricing and continue to hike, which has the potential of triggering a redux of 2013's \"Taper Tantrum\" and the liquidation risk mentioned above. Liquidity in crypto markets has dropped with trading volumes post-FTX. Until prices rise enough to reignite interest from traders who exited the market in 2022, we don't expect it to improve. With U.S. regulatory action against exchanges and the closure of a number of banks providing crypto on-ramping services, additional hurdles remain for capital entering into the digital-asset market these days.

Follow @ jackschickler on Twitter A \"rough year\" for crypto markets has underlined the need for comprehensive and consistent regulation of the sector, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said, suggesting stablecoin issuers and crypto conglomerates need to have bank-style capital requirements. In its \"Global Financial Stability Report\" published Tuesday, the IMF joins the standard setters at the Financial Stability Board in calling for consistent international regulation of the cryptocurrency sector after a year that has seen a number of collapses of major exchanges and crypto-linked banks. \u201cThe collapse of multiple entities in the crypto asset ecosystem has again made the call more urgent for comprehensive and consistent regulation and adequate supervision\u201d focused on protecting consumers and corporate governance, the report said. The report added that regulations should cover crypto storage, transfer, exchange and custody of reserves, with extra prudential requirements for those carrying out multiple functions and for the issuers of stablecoins \u2013 tokens that seek to maintain their value versus fiat currencies. The report cites a \u201crough year for crypto,\u201d in which the collapse of crypto- and tech-heavy lenders Silvergate, Signature and Silicon Valley Banks followed from the bankruptcy of the FTX crypto exchange in November. \u201cThese events add to questions about the viability of digital assets and reinforce the need for appropriate regulation,\u201d the IMF said. The IMF\u2019s report followed a warning issued earlier Tuesday by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) that financial authorities need to be able to monitor crypto leverage, decentralized finance and crypto staking and lending. \"Crypto-assets have experienced exponential growth in recent years, and the future development path of this market is uncertain,\u201d said a statement by the ESRB, a watchdog agency chaired by the European Central Bank\u2019s Christine Lagarde. The Financial Stability Board, a grouping of international regulators, is due to issue its own crypto rules in July, and its head, Klaas Knot, has already said many existing stablecoins would be unlikely to meet its strictures . Many traditional finance players want to see curbs on crypto conglomerates because the mixing of different financial functions could lead to conflicts of interest , despite concerns about constraining innovation. The IMF\u2019s Executive Board has previously expressed concerns over the potential of crypto to usurp the role of legal tender , though it stopped short of calling for an outright ban on digital assets.

Wallet services such as Lace may allow users to easily access decentralized-finance tools and be incentivized for using services on any blockchain, which may boost the token ecosystem for that network as it attracts traders hunting for opportunities that may have worn off on other networks.

RSS3 aims to be a bridge between blockchain technology and AI, search engines and social media. It has previously attracted investment from Coinbase, Dragonfly and noted entrepreneur and former Andreessen Horowitz partner Balaji Srinivasan. The protocol's latest investment follows its unveiling of RSS3 AIOP, an AI training environment providing Web3 information to the likes of ChatGPT. Traders have been betting on the potential of artificial intelligence and crypto, following the recent rise in popularity of AI-driven chatbots such as ChatGPT and image generation software DALL-E. While these do not actually use blockchain technology or cryptocurrency, crypto traders have nonetheless been drawn to AI-focused tokens as the next big growth area. \"We believe RSS3 is perfectly positioned to empower developers to create diverse, cutting-edge applications that will redefine how we interact with the web3 ecosystem,\" DWF Labs' managing partner Andrei Grachev said. RSS3's token has a market cap of just under $60 million at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap data . The $10 million purchase by DWF Labs is the firm's tenth investment of at least $10 million into crypto and Web3 projects in less than two months.

Follow @ egreechee on Twitter Crypto miner CleanSpark (CLSK) bought 45,000 new Bitmain Antminer S19 XPs for $144.9 million, which will almost double its current computing power, or hashrate, once installed, the firm said in a Tuesday press release. This is the latest in a series of acquisition of distressed assets by the miner, which started in the summer of 2022. The 45,000 Antminers will add over 6.3 exahash/second (EH/s) of computing power to CleanSpark's fleet of 6.7 EH/s, once delivered and installed. The acquisition announcement comes as bitcoin crossed $30,000 for the first time in nearly a year, which could reinvigorate the bitcoin mining space. The first batch of 25,000 rigs will be ready for delivery in August from Bitmain, and the rest are scheduled for September. They will be installed at a site in Sandersville, Georgia, which CleanSpark acquired from Mawson Infrastructure (MIGI) in September. CleanSpark aims to have 16 EH/s of computing power by the end of the year. It lowered its 2023 guidance in December 2022 from 22.4 EH/s, citing delays in construction by one of its partners, Lancium. Another 2.44 EH/s of machines that it acquired at a discount in February are expected to be online at a Washington state facility later in Q2. \"As bitcoin\u2019s halving draws closer, our focus on operational efficiency, our technical expertise, and our treasury management strategy, will all play a crucial role in solidifying CleanSpark\u2019s position among the top bitcoin mining companies in America,\" said Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark.

Follow @ BrandyBetz on Twitter Noted venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has released its second annual \"State of Crypto\" report highlighting the importance of Web3, blockchain infrastructure and a price-innovation cycle that makes the bear market a prime time for builders. The firm also unveiled on Tuesday its new State of Crypto Index , an interactive tool that tracks on a monthly basis 14 technology-focused metrics that offer a health snapshot of sorts for the industry. \u201cOur 2023 report aims to address the imbalance between the noise of fleeting price movements \u2013 and the data that tracks the signals that matter, including the durable progress of Web3 technology. Overall, the report reflects a healthier industry than market prices may indicate, and a steady cycle of development, product launches, and ongoing innovation,\u201d wrote a16z\u2019s Daren Matsuoka, Eddy Lazzarin, Robert Hackett and Stephanie Zinn in a blog post . The report says that the headline-grabbing scandals and collapses of the past year have demonstrated the failure of centralized systems versus the open, resilient nature of decentralized infrastructure. A16z notes that Web3 is \u201cmore than a financial movement, it\u2019s an evolution of the internet\u201d and it advances the internet through \u201ccrypto computers, not crypto casinos.\u201d A16z notes the advantages of Web3 over prior technological models include decentralized blockchain networks, the community-governed nature, the lack of power consolidation among corporations and value occurring to network participants. Web3 adoption is still in its early stages, and decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) metrics have become more stable after falling from record highs in 2021, according to the report. Gaming has shown particular strength: 700 Web3 games launched last year, and games now generate 23 times more on-chain transactions than DeFi. Last month in the broader crypto industry, there were more than 15 million active addresses, the highest number the firm has ever tracked and more than twice as much as seen in March 2021. The price-innovation cycle says that market downturns bring more dedicated developers into the crypto space and then the excitement around those projects eventually begins to drive asset prices higher. \u201cProduct cycles are where new things that lead to consistent and more robust growth over many years are occurring, regardless of financial cycles,\u201d A16z Chief Technology Officer Eddy Lazzarin told CoinDesk during an interview. A16z highlighted the ongoing improvements in blockchain infrastructure. Key factors include new layer 1 chains that improve scalability and programmability and layer 2 scaling systems, such as optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups. The firm is particularly positive on zero-knowledge proofs, a method of computationally verifying that a transaction is valid.

The call for attorneys to join the regulator's Crypto Asset and Cyber Unit, or CACU, comes after the agency said in March that it was \"planning to add additional staff\" to the unit , which was initially meant to be a 20-person operation but has since doubled in size. Under Chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC has been cracking down on the crypto industry with renewed vigor since the 2022 market turmoil saw the collapse of big firms in the sector, crypto exchange FTX among them. The attorneys joining the CACU are expected to conduct investigations involving \"crypto asset securities,\" develop litigation plans, draft legal documents including subpoenas and conduct depositions. The CACU \"exercises the full range of the Division's investigative and law enforcement powers, and focuses on violations of the federal securities laws,\" the job posting said. Compensation for the positions range between $140,000 and $260,000 depending on the location. Applications for the positions close on April 17, according to the posting.

                  "content": "Todd Groth Todd Groth is Head of Index Research at CoinDesk Indices. . He has over 10 years of experience involving systematic multi-asset risk premia and alternative investment strategies. Follow @ tgroth8 on Twitter It\u2019s been quite a start to the year in the world of crypto. Bitcoin ( BTC ) posted its best quarterly performance in over two years, gaining 68%, for the first three months of 2023. The broader CoinDesk Market Index, or CMI \u2013 which spans over 90% of the crypto market capitalization \u2013 is up 58% on the quarter with ether ( ETH ) and cardano ( ADA ) up 50% and 57% over the same period. Todd Groth is head of research at CoinDesk Indices , a provider of digital asset indices since 2014. The computing sector, or CPU (+67%), benefited from the positive sentiment surrounding artificial intelligence sparked by the the debut of ChatGPT last November. The currency sector, or CCY (+63%), benefited from the U.S. regional bank jitters and from the expansion across central bank balance sheets. January\u2019s rebound in investor sentiment (see \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d) has provided buoyancy for the broad market after a challenging 2022. Digitization, or BTZ (+24%), and DeFi, or DCF (+43%), are also positive for the year. Figure 1: CMI Sector 2023 Performance Attribution; Source: CDI Research Digital assets tend to do best when they trade according to their own narrative (say like bitcoin\u2019s inflation hedge thesis) and decouple from the factors and themes driving traditional asset classes. So far in 2023, crypto appears to be bucking trends driving stocks and bonds, including 2022 inflation fears and quantitative-tightening at the Federal Reserve. Digital assets have less in common now with growth-oriented equities, with a lowering of correlation between digital assets and equities. Within bitcoin specifically, we're also seeing a strengthening in the correlation with gold (positive) and the U.S. dollar (negative). The \u201cdigital gold\u201d and fiat \u201ccurrency debasement hedge\u201d narratives re-emerge and regain investor consideration. Figure 2: One-hour correlations between bitcoin (XBX) vs macro indexes. Source: CDI Research Bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed partly to the steepening of the yield curve in the bond market. We continue to see a moderately negative relationship between bitcoin price changes and the yield curve slope (using the five-year to the 30-year yield spread as proxies), which is a market-derived proxy for interest-rate expectations based on U.S. Treasury bond pricing. The recent peak in U.S. yield curve inversion of +46 basis points on March 8, just before the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, tumbled to -15 basis points as of March 27 as the market priced in fewer rate hikes and cuts post-SVB. This 60 basis-point drop in yield curve slope (with five-year rates dropping more than 30-year rates, bull steeping), combined with the negative correlation of -0.4 between the yield curve slope and bitcoin, suggests one-third of bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed to the steepening of the yield curve. This relationship between bitcoin and the yield curve strengthened during the Silicon Valley Bank event, supporting the digital gold narrative. With the Federal Reserve's balance sheet continuing to expand, in a mere two weeks the new lending facilities created to mitigate the regional banking crisis in March have undone months of balance sheet tightening. The Fed\u2019s actions come alongside continued monetary stimulus coming from the Bank of Japan (buying domestic bonds to maintain yield curve control) and the People\u2019s Bank of China, which is stimulating an economy weakened by COVID lockdowns. From the perspective of a digitally scarce asset like bitcoin, these are all encouraging developments. But it\u2019s unlikely we are heading for a halcyon redux of 2021\u2019s crypto bull market The U.S. regional banking concerns and the rapid unwind of Credit Suisse (CS) have highlighted weaknesses in the traditional financial system when interest rates rise. While this may come to the delight or amusement of crypto maximalists and critics of the fractionalized banking system, it is a source for further deleveraging contagion risk. Most digital-asset investments share a broader portfolio with traditional public and private-asset markets, with capital allocation decisions within these portfolios linking these disparate markets together through relative value choices which promote and drive correlations across markets. Crypto cannot sail alone. That the Fed will make fewer hikes, and more rate cuts, is pretty much priced into the market now and reflected in the yield curve steepening mentioned above. That has benefited bitcoin and gold, and at the expense of the U.S. dollar. A portion of these rate expectations might be due to the move of investors out of banking deposits and into front-end Treasurys for corporate treasury risk-management purposes. Why hold deposits at a regional bank, when you can earn similar interest in short-term paper without the credit risk of a potentially shaky bank? That said, the market appears to view the collapse of SVB as a pivot in the interest-rate hiking cycle. If the tightening of credit conditions and lending standards begin to percolate through the economy and inflation cools down further, then the Federal Reserve will no longer have to hike rates as the credit markets have effectively tightened financial conditions on the Fed\u2019s behalf. But if inflation remains persistent and elevated, the Fed will have to go against market pricing and continue to hike, which has the potential of triggering a redux of 2013's \"Taper Tantrum\" and the liquidation risk mentioned above. Liquidity in crypto markets has dropped with trading volumes post-FTX. Until prices rise enough to reignite interest from traders who exited the market in 2022, we don't expect it to improve. With U.S. regulatory action against exchanges and the closure of a number of banks providing crypto on-ramping services, additional hurdles remain for capital entering into the digital-asset market these days.

Follow @ jackschickler on Twitter A \"rough year\" for crypto markets has underlined the need for comprehensive and consistent regulation of the sector, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said, suggesting stablecoin issuers and crypto conglomerates need to have bank-style capital requirements. In its \"Global Financial Stability Report\" published Tuesday, the IMF joins the standard setters at the Financial Stability Board in calling for consistent international regulation of the cryptocurrency sector after a year that has seen a number of collapses of major exchanges and crypto-linked banks. \u201cThe collapse of multiple entities in the crypto asset ecosystem has again made the call more urgent for comprehensive and consistent regulation and adequate supervision\u201d focused on protecting consumers and corporate governance, the report said. The report added that regulations should cover crypto storage, transfer, exchange and custody of reserves, with extra prudential requirements for those carrying out multiple functions and for the issuers of stablecoins \u2013 tokens that seek to maintain their value versus fiat currencies. The report cites a \u201crough year for crypto,\u201d in which the collapse of crypto- and tech-heavy lenders Silvergate, Signature and Silicon Valley Banks followed from the bankruptcy of the FTX crypto exchange in November. \u201cThese events add to questions about the viability of digital assets and reinforce the need for appropriate regulation,\u201d the IMF said. The IMF\u2019s report followed a warning issued earlier Tuesday by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) that financial authorities need to be able to monitor crypto leverage, decentralized finance and crypto staking and lending. \"Crypto-assets have experienced exponential growth in recent years, and the future development path of this market is uncertain,\u201d said a statement by the ESRB, a watchdog agency chaired by the European Central Bank\u2019s Christine Lagarde. The Financial Stability Board, a grouping of international regulators, is due to issue its own crypto rules in July, and its head, Klaas Knot, has already said many existing stablecoins would be unlikely to meet its strictures . Many traditional finance players want to see curbs on crypto conglomerates because the mixing of different financial functions could lead to conflicts of interest , despite concerns about constraining innovation. The IMF\u2019s Executive Board has previously expressed concerns over the potential of crypto to usurp the role of legal tender , though it stopped short of calling for an outright ban on digital assets.

Lace is a browser-based wallet similar to the popular MetaMask product. It allows users to access the Cardano network directly and use Cardano-based decentralized applications . Users can send and receive Cardano digital assets like ADA, Cardano non-fungible tokens and Cardano-native tokens. They can also stake ADA directly from the wallet to contribute to the security of the network and receive rewards for their participation, Lace will enable users to send multiple assets to different addresses in one transaction \u2013 with one transaction fee \u2013 through a new \"bundle transaction\" feature, which groups transactions into one bundle to save costs. Developers said they expect to add fiat-to-crypto on-ramps, a dapp store, in-wallet swaps and staking enchantments in future releases. Wallet services such as Lace may allow users to easily access decentralized-finance tools and be incentivized for using services on any blockchain, which may boost the token ecosystem for that network as it attracts traders hunting for opportunities that may have worn off on other networks.

RSS3 aims to be a bridge between blockchain technology and AI, search engines and social media. It has previously attracted investment from Coinbase, Dragonfly and noted entrepreneur and former Andreessen Horowitz partner Balaji Srinivasan. The protocol's latest investment follows its unveiling of RSS3 AIOP, an AI training environment providing Web3 information to the likes of ChatGPT. Traders have been betting on the potential of artificial intelligence and crypto, following the recent rise in popularity of AI-driven chatbots such as ChatGPT and image generation software DALL-E. While these do not actually use blockchain technology or cryptocurrency, crypto traders have nonetheless been drawn to AI-focused tokens as the next big growth area. \"We believe RSS3 is perfectly positioned to empower developers to create diverse, cutting-edge applications that will redefine how we interact with the web3 ecosystem,\" DWF Labs' managing partner Andrei Grachev said. RSS3's token has a market cap of just under $60 million at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap data . The $10 million purchase by DWF Labs is the firm's tenth investment of at least $10 million into crypto and Web3 projects in less than two months.

This will dramatically open up the market to many more participants on both sides of the market.\u201d Xclaim says it has listed more than $1 billion of claims and traded more than $200 million in volume since it started operations in 2018, with 500 registered investors \u2013 typically individuals or firms experienced with bankruptcy claims purchasing \u2013 on the platform.

OPNX has struggled to obtain momentum, however, with CoinGecko reporting that the exchange only has $179,235 in volume. In an earlier interview with CoinDesk , Xclaim Chief Strategy Officer Andrew Glantz said the majority of interest is from Asia-based sellers of claims. Glantz said 50% of participants come from Singapore, 15% from China and 23% from Taiwan. Taiwan experienced significant per-capita losses on FTX, owing to the strong interest of Taiwanese individuals in the platform's attractive returns on U.S. dollar deposits. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

Follow @ egreechee on Twitter Crypto miner CleanSpark (CLSK) bought 45,000 new Bitmain Antminer S19 XPs for $144.9 million, which will almost double its current computing power, or hashrate, once installed, the firm said in a Tuesday press release. This is the latest in a series of acquisition of distressed assets by the miner, which started in the summer of 2022. The 45,000 Antminers will add over 6.3 exahash/second (EH/s) of computing power to CleanSpark's fleet of 6.7 EH/s, once delivered and installed. The acquisition announcement comes as bitcoin crossed $30,000 for the first time in nearly a year, which could reinvigorate the bitcoin mining space. The first batch of 25,000 rigs will be ready for delivery in August from Bitmain, and the rest are scheduled for September. They will be installed at a site in Sandersville, Georgia, which CleanSpark acquired from Mawson Infrastructure (MIGI) in September. CleanSpark aims to have 16 EH/s of computing power by the end of the year. It lowered its 2023 guidance in December 2022 from 22.4 EH/s, citing delays in construction by one of its partners, Lancium. Another 2.44 EH/s of machines that it acquired at a discount in February are expected to be online at a Washington state facility later in Q2. \"As bitcoin\u2019s halving draws closer, our focus on operational efficiency, our technical expertise, and our treasury management strategy, will all play a crucial role in solidifying CleanSpark\u2019s position among the top bitcoin mining companies in America,\" said Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark.

Follow @ BrandyBetz on Twitter Noted venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has released its second annual \"State of Crypto\" report highlighting the importance of Web3, blockchain infrastructure and a price-innovation cycle that makes the bear market a prime time for builders. The firm also unveiled on Tuesday its new State of Crypto Index , an interactive tool that tracks on a monthly basis 14 technology-focused metrics that offer a health snapshot of sorts for the industry. \u201cOur 2023 report aims to address the imbalance between the noise of fleeting price movements \u2013 and the data that tracks the signals that matter, including the durable progress of Web3 technology. Overall, the report reflects a healthier industry than market prices may indicate, and a steady cycle of development, product launches, and ongoing innovation,\u201d wrote a16z\u2019s Daren Matsuoka, Eddy Lazzarin, Robert Hackett and Stephanie Zinn in a blog post . The report says that the headline-grabbing scandals and collapses of the past year have demonstrated the failure of centralized systems versus the open, resilient nature of decentralized infrastructure. A16z notes that Web3 is \u201cmore than a financial movement, it\u2019s an evolution of the internet\u201d and it advances the internet through \u201ccrypto computers, not crypto casinos.\u201d A16z notes the advantages of Web3 over prior technological models include decentralized blockchain networks, the community-governed nature, the lack of power consolidation among corporations and value occurring to network participants. Web3 adoption is still in its early stages, and decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) metrics have become more stable after falling from record highs in 2021, according to the report. Gaming has shown particular strength: 700 Web3 games launched last year, and games now generate 23 times more on-chain transactions than DeFi. Last month in the broader crypto industry, there were more than 15 million active addresses, the highest number the firm has ever tracked and more than twice as much as seen in March 2021. The price-innovation cycle says that market downturns bring more dedicated developers into the crypto space and then the excitement around those projects eventually begins to drive asset prices higher. \u201cProduct cycles are where new things that lead to consistent and more robust growth over many years are occurring, regardless of financial cycles,\u201d A16z Chief Technology Officer Eddy Lazzarin told CoinDesk during an interview. A16z highlighted the ongoing improvements in blockchain infrastructure. Key factors include new layer 1 chains that improve scalability and programmability and layer 2 scaling systems, such as optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups. The firm is particularly positive on zero-knowledge proofs, a method of computationally verifying that a transaction is valid.

The call for attorneys to join the regulator's Crypto Asset and Cyber Unit, or CACU, comes after the agency said in March that it was \"planning to add additional staff\" to the unit , which was initially meant to be a 20-person operation but has since doubled in size. Under Chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC has been cracking down on the crypto industry with renewed vigor since the 2022 market turmoil saw the collapse of big firms in the sector, crypto exchange FTX among them. The attorneys joining the CACU are expected to conduct investigations involving \"crypto asset securities,\" develop litigation plans, draft legal documents including subpoenas and conduct depositions. The CACU \"exercises the full range of the Division's investigative and law enforcement powers, and focuses on violations of the federal securities laws,\" the job posting said. Compensation for the positions range between $140,000 and $260,000 depending on the location. Applications for the positions close on April 17, according to the posting.

                  "content": "Todd Groth Todd Groth is Head of Index Research at CoinDesk Indices. . He has over 10 years of experience involving systematic multi-asset risk premia and alternative investment strategies. Follow @ tgroth8 on Twitter It\u2019s been quite a start to the year in the world of crypto. Bitcoin ( BTC ) posted its best quarterly performance in over two years, gaining 68%, for the first three months of 2023. The broader CoinDesk Market Index, or CMI \u2013 which spans over 90% of the crypto market capitalization \u2013 is up 58% on the quarter with ether ( ETH ) and cardano ( ADA ) up 50% and 57% over the same period. Todd Groth is head of research at CoinDesk Indices , a provider of digital asset indices since 2014. The computing sector, or CPU (+67%), benefited from the positive sentiment surrounding artificial intelligence sparked by the the debut of ChatGPT last November. The currency sector, or CCY (+63%), benefited from the U.S. regional bank jitters and from the expansion across central bank balance sheets. January\u2019s rebound in investor sentiment (see \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d) has provided buoyancy for the broad market after a challenging 2022. Digitization, or BTZ (+24%), and DeFi, or DCF (+43%), are also positive for the year. Figure 1: CMI Sector 2023 Performance Attribution; Source: CDI Research Digital assets tend to do best when they trade according to their own narrative (say like bitcoin\u2019s inflation hedge thesis) and decouple from the factors and themes driving traditional asset classes. So far in 2023, crypto appears to be bucking trends driving stocks and bonds, including 2022 inflation fears and quantitative-tightening at the Federal Reserve. Digital assets have less in common now with growth-oriented equities, with a lowering of correlation between digital assets and equities. Within bitcoin specifically, we're also seeing a strengthening in the correlation with gold (positive) and the U.S. dollar (negative). The \u201cdigital gold\u201d and fiat \u201ccurrency debasement hedge\u201d narratives re-emerge and regain investor consideration. Figure 2: One-hour correlations between bitcoin (XBX) vs macro indexes. Source: CDI Research Bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed partly to the steepening of the yield curve in the bond market. We continue to see a moderately negative relationship between bitcoin price changes and the yield curve slope (using the five-year to the 30-year yield spread as proxies), which is a market-derived proxy for interest-rate expectations based on U.S. Treasury bond pricing. The recent peak in U.S. yield curve inversion of +46 basis points on March 8, just before the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, tumbled to -15 basis points as of March 27 as the market priced in fewer rate hikes and cuts post-SVB. This 60 basis-point drop in yield curve slope (with five-year rates dropping more than 30-year rates, bull steeping), combined with the negative correlation of -0.4 between the yield curve slope and bitcoin, suggests one-third of bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed to the steepening of the yield curve. This relationship between bitcoin and the yield curve strengthened during the Silicon Valley Bank event, supporting the digital gold narrative. With the Federal Reserve's balance sheet continuing to expand, in a mere two weeks the new lending facilities created to mitigate the regional banking crisis in March have undone months of balance sheet tightening. The Fed\u2019s actions come alongside continued monetary stimulus coming from the Bank of Japan (buying domestic bonds to maintain yield curve control) and the People\u2019s Bank of China, which is stimulating an economy weakened by COVID lockdowns. From the perspective of a digitally scarce asset like bitcoin, these are all encouraging developments. But it\u2019s unlikely we are heading for a halcyon redux of 2021\u2019s crypto bull market The U.S. regional banking concerns and the rapid unwind of Credit Suisse (CS) have highlighted weaknesses in the traditional financial system when interest rates rise. While this may come to the delight or amusement of crypto maximalists and critics of the fractionalized banking system, it is a source for further deleveraging contagion risk. Most digital-asset investments share a broader portfolio with traditional public and private-asset markets, with capital allocation decisions within these portfolios linking these disparate markets together through relative value choices which promote and drive correlations across markets. Crypto cannot sail alone. That the Fed will make fewer hikes, and more rate cuts, is pretty much priced into the market now and reflected in the yield curve steepening mentioned above. That has benefited bitcoin and gold, and at the expense of the U.S. dollar. A portion of these rate expectations might be due to the move of investors out of banking deposits and into front-end Treasurys for corporate treasury risk-management purposes. Why hold deposits at a regional bank, when you can earn similar interest in short-term paper without the credit risk of a potentially shaky bank? That said, the market appears to view the collapse of SVB as a pivot in the interest-rate hiking cycle. If the tightening of credit conditions and lending standards begin to percolate through the economy and inflation cools down further, then the Federal Reserve will no longer have to hike rates as the credit markets have effectively tightened financial conditions on the Fed\u2019s behalf. But if inflation remains persistent and elevated, the Fed will have to go against market pricing and continue to hike, which has the potential of triggering a redux of 2013's \"Taper Tantrum\" and the liquidation risk mentioned above. Liquidity in crypto markets has dropped with trading volumes post-FTX. Until prices rise enough to reignite interest from traders who exited the market in 2022, we don't expect it to improve. With U.S. regulatory action against exchanges and the closure of a number of banks providing crypto on-ramping services, additional hurdles remain for capital entering into the digital-asset market these days.

Follow @ jackschickler on Twitter A \"rough year\" for crypto markets has underlined the need for comprehensive and consistent regulation of the sector, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said, suggesting stablecoin issuers and crypto conglomerates need to have bank-style capital requirements. In its \"Global Financial Stability Report\" published Tuesday, the IMF joins the standard setters at the Financial Stability Board in calling for consistent international regulation of the cryptocurrency sector after a year that has seen a number of collapses of major exchanges and crypto-linked banks. \u201cThe collapse of multiple entities in the crypto asset ecosystem has again made the call more urgent for comprehensive and consistent regulation and adequate supervision\u201d focused on protecting consumers and corporate governance, the report said. The report added that regulations should cover crypto storage, transfer, exchange and custody of reserves, with extra prudential requirements for those carrying out multiple functions and for the issuers of stablecoins \u2013 tokens that seek to maintain their value versus fiat currencies. The report cites a \u201crough year for crypto,\u201d in which the collapse of crypto- and tech-heavy lenders Silvergate, Signature and Silicon Valley Banks followed from the bankruptcy of the FTX crypto exchange in November. \u201cThese events add to questions about the viability of digital assets and reinforce the need for appropriate regulation,\u201d the IMF said. The IMF\u2019s report followed a warning issued earlier Tuesday by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) that financial authorities need to be able to monitor crypto leverage, decentralized finance and crypto staking and lending. \"Crypto-assets have experienced exponential growth in recent years, and the future development path of this market is uncertain,\u201d said a statement by the ESRB, a watchdog agency chaired by the European Central Bank\u2019s Christine Lagarde. The Financial Stability Board, a grouping of international regulators, is due to issue its own crypto rules in July, and its head, Klaas Knot, has already said many existing stablecoins would be unlikely to meet its strictures . Many traditional finance players want to see curbs on crypto conglomerates because the mixing of different financial functions could lead to conflicts of interest , despite concerns about constraining innovation. The IMF\u2019s Executive Board has previously expressed concerns over the potential of crypto to usurp the role of legal tender , though it stopped short of calling for an outright ban on digital assets.

They can also stake ADA directly from the wallet to contribute to the security of the network and receive rewards for their participation, Lace will enable users to send multiple assets to different addresses in one transaction \u2013 with one transaction fee \u2013 through a new \"bundle transaction\" feature, which groups transactions into one bundle to save costs. Developers said they expect to add fiat-to-crypto on-ramps, a dapp store, in-wallet swaps and staking enchantments in future releases. Wallet services such as Lace may allow users to easily access decentralized-finance tools and be incentivized for using services on any blockchain, which may boost the token ecosystem for that network as it attracts traders hunting for opportunities that may have worn off on other networks. ADA is up 5.3% in the past 24 hours. Edited by Sheldon Reback. DISCLOSURE Please note that our privacy policy , terms of use , cookies , and do not sell my personal information has been updated .

Follow @ JamieCrawleyCD on Twitter Information protocol RSS3 has raised $10 million via a token sale to prolific Web3 investor DWF Labs, according to an emailed announcement shared with CoinDesk. RSS3 aims to be a bridge between blockchain technology and AI, search engines and social media. It has previously attracted investment from Coinbase, Dragonfly and noted entrepreneur and former Andreessen Horowitz partner Balaji Srinivasan. The protocol's latest investment follows its unveiling of RSS3 AIOP, an AI training environment providing Web3 information to the likes of ChatGPT. Traders have been betting on the potential of artificial intelligence and crypto, following the recent rise in popularity of AI-driven chatbots such as ChatGPT and image generation software DALL-E. While these do not actually use blockchain technology or cryptocurrency, crypto traders have nonetheless been drawn to AI-focused tokens as the next big growth area. \"We believe RSS3 is perfectly positioned to empower developers to create diverse, cutting-edge applications that will redefine how we interact with the web3 ecosystem,\" DWF Labs' managing partner Andrei Grachev said. RSS3's token has a market cap of just under $60 million at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap data . The $10 million purchase by DWF Labs is the firm's tenth investment of at least $10 million into crypto and Web3 projects in less than two months.

Xclaim allows for the trading of major bankruptcy creditor claims, including FTX, CoinDesk sister company Genesis and BlockFi. Currently, FTX claims are going for 19 cents on the dollar, up from 13 cents earlier this year , while Genesis is going for 52.5 cents and BlockFi for 18 cents. \u201cTo further enhance liquidity, we intend to use the capital from our recent fundraise to expand our products and service offerings. We are most excited about our innovation of Collateralized Claim Obligations,\u201d founder and CEO Matthew Sedigh, said in a note. \u201cBy aggregating diversified pools of thousands of claims under a single umbrella, we will have created commoditized products from bespoke assets. This will dramatically open up the market to many more participants on both sides of the market.\u201d Xclaim says it has listed more than $1 billion of claims and traded more than $200 million in volume since it started operations in 2018, with 500 registered investors \u2013 typically individuals or firms experienced with bankruptcy claims purchasing \u2013 on the platform.

OPNX has struggled to obtain momentum, however, with CoinGecko reporting that the exchange only has $179,235 in volume. In an earlier interview with CoinDesk , Xclaim Chief Strategy Officer Andrew Glantz said the majority of interest is from Asia-based sellers of claims. Glantz said 50% of participants come from Singapore, 15% from China and 23% from Taiwan. Taiwan experienced significant per-capita losses on FTX, owing to the strong interest of Taiwanese individuals in the platform's attractive returns on U.S. dollar deposits. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

Follow @ egreechee on Twitter Crypto miner CleanSpark (CLSK) bought 45,000 new Bitmain Antminer S19 XPs for $144.9 million, which will almost double its current computing power, or hashrate, once installed, the firm said in a Tuesday press release. This is the latest in a series of acquisition of distressed assets by the miner, which started in the summer of 2022. The 45,000 Antminers will add over 6.3 exahash/second (EH/s) of computing power to CleanSpark's fleet of 6.7 EH/s, once delivered and installed. The acquisition announcement comes as bitcoin crossed $30,000 for the first time in nearly a year, which could reinvigorate the bitcoin mining space. The first batch of 25,000 rigs will be ready for delivery in August from Bitmain, and the rest are scheduled for September. They will be installed at a site in Sandersville, Georgia, which CleanSpark acquired from Mawson Infrastructure (MIGI) in September. CleanSpark aims to have 16 EH/s of computing power by the end of the year. It lowered its 2023 guidance in December 2022 from 22.4 EH/s, citing delays in construction by one of its partners, Lancium. Another 2.44 EH/s of machines that it acquired at a discount in February are expected to be online at a Washington state facility later in Q2. \"As bitcoin\u2019s halving draws closer, our focus on operational efficiency, our technical expertise, and our treasury management strategy, will all play a crucial role in solidifying CleanSpark\u2019s position among the top bitcoin mining companies in America,\" said Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark.

                  "content": "Brandy Betz Brandy covers crypto-related venture capital deals for CoinDesk. Follow @ BrandyBetz on Twitter Noted venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has released its second annual \"State of Crypto\" report highlighting the importance of Web3, blockchain infrastructure and a price-innovation cycle that makes the bear market a prime time for builders. The firm also unveiled on Tuesday its new State of Crypto Index , an interactive tool that tracks on a monthly basis 14 technology-focused metrics that offer a health snapshot of sorts for the industry. \u201cOur 2023 report aims to address the imbalance between the noise of fleeting price movements \u2013 and the data that tracks the signals that matter, including the durable progress of Web3 technology. Overall, the report reflects a healthier industry than market prices may indicate, and a steady cycle of development, product launches, and ongoing innovation,\u201d wrote a16z\u2019s Daren Matsuoka, Eddy Lazzarin, Robert Hackett and Stephanie Zinn in a blog post . The report says that the headline-grabbing scandals and collapses of the past year have demonstrated the failure of centralized systems versus the open, resilient nature of decentralized infrastructure. A16z notes that Web3 is \u201cmore than a financial movement, it\u2019s an evolution of the internet\u201d and it advances the internet through \u201ccrypto computers, not crypto casinos.\u201d A16z notes the advantages of Web3 over prior technological models include decentralized blockchain networks, the community-governed nature, the lack of power consolidation among corporations and value occurring to network participants. Web3 adoption is still in its early stages, and decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) metrics have become more stable after falling from record highs in 2021, according to the report. Gaming has shown particular strength: 700 Web3 games launched last year, and games now generate 23 times more on-chain transactions than DeFi. Last month in the broader crypto industry, there were more than 15 million active addresses, the highest number the firm has ever tracked and more than twice as much as seen in March 2021. The price-innovation cycle says that market downturns bring more dedicated developers into the crypto space and then the excitement around those projects eventually begins to drive asset prices higher. \u201cProduct cycles are where new things that lead to consistent and more robust growth over many years are occurring, regardless of financial cycles,\u201d A16z Chief Technology Officer Eddy Lazzarin told CoinDesk during an interview. A16z highlighted the ongoing improvements in blockchain infrastructure. Key factors include new layer 1 chains that improve scalability and programmability and layer 2 scaling systems, such as optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups. The firm is particularly positive on zero-knowledge proofs, a method of computationally verifying that a transaction is valid.

Follow @ iamsandali on Twitter The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is hiring general attorneys for its crypto enforcement division in New York, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, according to a job posting . The call for attorneys to join the regulator's Crypto Asset and Cyber Unit, or CACU, comes after the agency said in March that it was \"planning to add additional staff\" to the unit , which was initially meant to be a 20-person operation but has since doubled in size. Under Chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC has been cracking down on the crypto industry with renewed vigor since the 2022 market turmoil saw the collapse of big firms in the sector, crypto exchange FTX among them. The attorneys joining the CACU are expected to conduct investigations involving \"crypto asset securities,\" develop litigation plans, draft legal documents including subpoenas and conduct depositions. The CACU \"exercises the full range of the Division's investigative and law enforcement powers, and focuses on violations of the federal securities laws,\" the job posting said. Compensation for the positions range between $140,000 and $260,000 depending on the location. Applications for the positions close on April 17, according to the posting.

Cynthia Del Pozo Garcia, Gemini's director of strategy and corporate development, wrote: According to Del Pozo Garcia, Gemini holds holds \"many licenses globally,\" such as state money transmitter licenses, an E-Money License from the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom, and an E-Money License from the Central Bank of Ireland. \"Related to our licenses, Gemini must undergo annual audits of our financial statements and is subject to bank examinations conducted by the New York Department of Financial Services,\" the director said. On Feb. 22, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) published a notice requiring all crypto asset trading platforms to sign a legally binding pre-registration undertaking to continue operating in the country. Among many restrictions, exchanges will be prohibited from allowing Canadian clients to buy or deposit stablecoins without prior approval from the CSA. Since the new regulations took effect, cryptocurrency exchange OKX has announced it would cease operations in Canada by June 2023. Meanwhile, fintech company Paxos said it would withdraw from Canada , citing regulatory uncertainty.

                  "description": "BTC price continues to show strength and derivatives data suggests that bulls intend to press Bitcoin higher.",
                  "content": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) price maintained the $30,000 support as lower-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released on April 12. The official inflation rate for March increased 5% year on year, which was slightly less than the 5.1% consensus. It was the lowest reading since May 2021, but is still significantly higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The data suggests that inflation is no longer the driving force behind Bitcoin\u2019s rally and Investors' focus shifted from the impact of inflationary pressure to potential recession risks after the banking crisis revealed how fragile the financial system was following the Federal Reserve's twelve-month hike in interest rates from 0.10% to 4.85%. Aside from the Silicon Valley Bank bankruptcy and the government-backed sale of Credit Suisse to UBS, several warning signs of a macroeconomic downturn have emerged. The most recent ISM Purchasing Managers Index data fell to its lowest level since May 2020, indicating an economic contraction. According to Federal Reserve documents released on April 12, the aftermath of the U.S. banking crisis is likely to push the economy into a \"mild recession\" later this year. Because of the crisis, some have speculated that the Fed will hold off on raising interest rates, but officials affirmed that more effort is needed to keep inflation under control. According to a Moody's Analytics report, commercial real estate prices fell 1.6% in February, the most since the 2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, the national office vacancy rate reached 16.5%, indicating the severity of the economic difficulties that businesses are currently facing. Whatever the reason for Bitcoin's 50% rally between March 11 and April 11, it demonstrates resilience to FUD, including the SEC's Wells Notice against Coinbase on March 22, and the CFTC filing a suit against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao on March 27. By holding the $30,000 support, Bitcoin demonstrates that the positive momentum can continue regardless of whether inflation remains above 5%. Not everyone is cheering the rally, particularly traders who have placed bearish bets using Bitcoin options. The April 14 open interest for BTC options expiry is $950 million, with $490 million in call (buy) options and $460 million in put (sell) options. Bears have been caught off guard, with less than 7% of their bets exceeding $29,000. Below are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of call (buy) and put (sell) options contracts available on April 14 varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit: This rough estimate considers only call options in bullish bets and put options in neutral-to-bearish trades. Nonetheless, this oversimplification excludes more complex investment strategies. A trader, for example, could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a certain price, but this effect is difficult to estimate. Related: Bitcoin-friendly PPI data boosts bulls as Ether price fights for $2K Bulls are expected to push Bitcoin above $30,500 on April 14 at 8:00 a.m UTC to profit an additional $100 million. Bears, on the other hand, would need to pressure Bitcoin's price below $29,000 in order to balance the scales. However, bears have recently suffered significant losses as BTC futures short contracts were forcibly liquidated to the tune of $128 million between April 9 and April 11. As the most likely scenario favors Bitcoin bulls, their profits will most likely be used to reinforce the $30,000 support. Bears might consider licking their wounds and waiting for additional actions from regulators as the macroeconomic scenario is currently bullish for supply capped assets.

                  "description": "You might think that new tax reporting rules for exchanges should mean less work for the taxpayer, but it\u2019s the opposite, says CPA Kirk Phillips.",
                  "content": "Kirk Phillips Kirk Phillips is a CPA, entrepreneur and founder of Global Crypto Advisors and Crypto Blocko, a business, accounting and tax resource site. This article is part of CoinDesk\u2019s Tax Week series. The U.S. Infrastructure and Jobs Act ushered in \u201cbroker reporting\u201d rules for centralized crypto exchanges, effectively turning digital assets into securities for purposes of the Section 6045 reporting requirement. Stock trading firms issue tax forms 1099-Bs with sales of securities and capital gains and losses, so centralized exchanges will do the same thing for crypto trades on the new Form 1099-DA. Cash App and Robinhood Crypto, for example, have already been issuing crypto trades on 1099-Bs for several years. This article is part of CoinDesk's Tax Guide 2023 . Kirk Phillips is an entrepreneur, Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and author of \"The Ultimate Bitcoin Business Guide: For Entrepreneurs & Business Advisors.\" At first glance it might seem like crypto reporting by exchanges means less work for the taxpayer, but it\u2019s the opposite. This creates a huge burden for centralized exchanges and saddles the taxpayer with a more onerous crypto tax reporting exercise. Taxpayers in other regimes that implement similar rules will suffer the same fate. Let\u2019s dig deeper and find out why. The U.S. has a voluntary tax compliance system where the taxpayer is responsible for calculating and filing their own taxes. Taxpayers report two kinds of information: The Internal Revenue Service matches amounts reported by third parties to make sure they\u2019re the same amounts reported by the taxpayer. Third-party tax forms include W-2s, 1099s, 1098s and so on. Taxpayers self-report any income, expenses or deductions not reported on third-party forms. Both of those reporting methods were completely separate until now. Crypto tax calculations were mostly the 100% self-reported variety, but the new broker reporting rules relegate taxpayers to a combination of third-party and self-reporting, and that\u2019s where the problem begins. Taxpayers will still manage their entire view of crypto tax calculations. Meanwhile, multiple exchanges will report their tiny view of a taxpayer\u2019s crypto landscape, leaving the taxpayer to piece together 1099-DAs and figure out whether they\u2019re correct. What\u2019s been described in these pages as \u201c The Maddening Task of Calculating Crypto Taxes \u201d is the first clue the new reporting rules will create more crypto tax headaches, not less. Taxpayers can easily rack up five to 10 times more wallets and exchange accounts than stock trading and bank accounts while having to untangle a web of crypto transactions contained within. Most crypto tax software providers deployed the universal cost basis feature that dumps all transactions into a single bucket for calculation purposes. Alice (not her real name!) has been in crypto for six years and accumulated seven exchange accounts and 13 wallets. The software commingles all her transactions from 2018 up to the current year and makes one calculation as if Alice was only using one wallet. Under the new rules, Alice would receive seven 1099-DAs in addition to her own universal calculation. Alice is no longer solely responsible for her crypto tax calculations and instead has eight parties, including herself, in on the calculation exercise. Alice has been calculating and self-reporting her crypto taxes on Form 8949 for years. She disregards the seven 1099-DAs because she\u2019s already included all her transactions in the current Form 8949. Alice files her tax return as usual and gets flustered after receiving an IRS notice saying she underreported income. Now Alice must amend her tax return and report the information as received on the 1099-DAs. Bob, on the other hand, has eight wallets and four exchange accounts. He reported four 1099-DAs on his tax return and deleted the transactions for those four exchanges from his crypto tax software. Bob thought this was a clever solution to avoid double-counting his exchange transactions, but he didn\u2019t realize two of the exchanges didn\u2019t report cost basis on 1099-DAs. As a result, he overstated his capital gains and significantly overpaid more tax than he should have. Bob and Alice have run headfirst into some of the numerous 1099-DA pitfalls. Now they must go through a rigorous exercise to reconcile all the 1099-DAs with their own universal calculation to double-check the exchanges correctly reported information. The challenge of managing crypto taxes just got magnified. In the absence of a thorough reconciliation and cross-checking exercise, taxpayers will otherwise double count and/or omit cost basis and therefore understate or overstate tax liabilities. Let\u2019s look at some other 1099-DA pitfalls. U.S. taxpayers can use FIFO, first in first out, or specific identification for crypto cost-basis methods just like securities sales. FIFO is simply a tracking method where the oldest crypto purchased is considered the first crypto sold and specific identification allows taxpayers to choose a specific batch of crypto to sell before selling it. In legacy finance, a taxpayer can give notice to their securities broker to use specific identification and then instruct the broker which tax lot of securities to sell. Specific identification doesn\u2019t work this way in crypto because both exchanges and crypto tax software don\u2019t provide any pre-sale identifying mechanisms. This means exchanges will default to providing FIFO-only cost basis on 1099-DAs. Meanwhile, taxpayers use several cost method methods, numerous other ways crypto is considered sold for tax purposes, as proxies for specific identification because the cost basis in the calculation is \u201cidentified\u201d after the sale instead of before. Nonetheless, if exchanges report on a FIFO basis and the taxpayer uses specific identification, then reconciling between the two will be impossible. This illustrates how cost basis would be double counted and/or omitted because the taxpayers and exchanges are using inconsistent cost basis methods. Cost-basis tracking on a per-wallet and exchange basis would help the reconciliation process but doesn\u2019t come without its own issues. Several crypto tax software providers, such as Cointracker and Bitwave, are rolling out per-wallet and exchange tracking and some already had these features. Alice has consistently used the FIFO cost basis method and wants to reconcile her 1099-DAs so she switches her crypto software from universal to per-wallet tracking. She\u2019s surprised to get different gains and losses for each tax year, but her new CPA explains the calculations go back to 2018 and the per-wallet method is recalculating what has already been calculated in prior years. Crypto software must lock down cost basis at the end of 2022, for example, so the shift to per wallet tracking avoids the double-counting and/or omissions dilemma. It\u2019s unclear how exchanges are going to manage customer basis and data tracking because 1099-DA reporting is currently deferred until final regulations are issued. One thing is clear, though \u2013 there will be differences and taxpayers will have extra work to correctly adjust gains and losses on their tax returns. Form 8949, used to report the detail all crypto trades, has adjustment codes to deal with incorrectly reported basis and other issues. However, this is easier said than done. In addition to the normal crypto tax headaches, taxpayers must track 1099-DA reconciliation differences, calculate adjustments and figure out reporting so final gains and losses are correct. There are also many other issues too numerous to mention here. Bob, a decentralized finance (DeFi) degen, wants to avoid the 1099-DA conundrums and decided to use his centralized exchanges as stablecoin-only on- and off-ramps and use DeFi protocols for all his other crypto activity. His 1099-DAs would only show stablecoin sales with gains and losses essentially zero, thus eliminating the reconciliation and adjustment exercise. Bob is going to minimize transfers among exchanges to keep activity as self-contained as possible. He\u2019s also considering opening new exchange accounts to containerize new trades and cost basis when 1099-DAs are finally issued. We need crypto tax management to get easier, not harder. The ideal compromise for final broker reporting rules would be removing the cost basis reporting requirement to eliminate most of the cost basis reconciliation headaches. Then taxpayers would only have to deal with reconciling reported proceeds from trades. Fortunately, the delay with 1099-DA will give more time for exchanges to develop better reporting, crypto tax software providers to develop more useful tracking features and taxpayers to strategize ways to minimize headaches. The IRS will be seeking public comments on proposed regulations to implement the broker reporting rules per Announcement 2023-2. Voice your opinion and contribute comments.

                  "content": "A federal magistrate judge has signed an order requiring BitBoy Crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong to appear in Florida as part of a status conference related to a lawsuit involving several crypto influencers. In an April 12 filing in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Judge Melissa Damian ordered Armstrong and his counsel to appear on April 20 along with the legal team representing the influencers. According to the order, the conference was aimed at bringing awareness of \u201cArmstrong\u2019s harassment towards plaintiffs\u2019 counsel.\u201d Armstrong, along with several other YouTubers, were named in a $1-billion lawsuit filed on March 15 for allegedly promoting \u201cFTX crypto fraud without disclosing compensation.\u201d Adam Moskowitz, representing plaintiff Edwin Garrison and others in the class-action lawsuit, has claimed that Armstrong harassed the legal team with \u201cendless phone calls, tweets and emails,\u201d voicemails \u201cfull of vulgarities,\u201d and social media posts suggesting threats. An April 5 filing showing cause for a hearing with Armstrong detailed \u201cdaily violent threats\u201d by the YouTuber in addition to responses to emails with threats and insults before being served with process papers. The legal team also reported in a March 20 filing that one of Armstrong\u2019s voicemails included the YouTuber allegedly threatening to surround Moskowitz\u2019s home with protesters \u201c24/7 day and night.\u201d \u201cThe scope of the attacks (including death threats), which examples are provided in those filings and which continue on a daily basis since, necessitated Undersigned Counsel to open an FBI investigation into Armstrong, as well as the investigation files by local police authorities for Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and their families,\u201d said Moskowitz. Twitter posts from Armstrong claimed the original lawsuit regarding disclosure of compensation from FTX had \u201cabsolutely no merit.\u201d The crypto influencer is no stranger to online controversy, regularly insulting high-profile figures, including European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde and being generally dismissive of the class-action lawsuit. So let me get this straight\u2026 Adam Moskowitz frivolously attaches me falsely as a paid promoter of FTX, a site where people lot EVERYTHING\u2026 many lost life savings. Many on brink of suicide. And this fragile pussy claims he is the one scared and at risk because I call him names. Related: YouTube appoints Web3-friendly exec as new CEO In August 2022, Armstrong filed a defamation suit against YouTuber Erling Mengshoel Jr. \u2014 also known as Atozy \u2014 in response to a video Mengshoel posted claiming that \u201cThis YouTuber scams his fans\u2026 Bitboy Crypto.\u201d Armstrong dropped the lawsuit after Mengshoel raised more than $200,000 in a campaign for his defense in less than 24 hours.

                  "description": "A Bitcoin-only policy organization in the United Kingdom seeks to steer a course for greater levels of BTC adoption.",
                  "content": "God save our gracious coin, and long live the coin. A team of entrepreneurs, environmentalists and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have assembled to back Bitcoin in Britain. Bitcoin Policy UK (BPUK) unites stakeholders, policymakers, environmentalists, tax specialists, Bitcoin experts and miners to \u201cunlock the potential of Bitcoin\u201d in Britain and explore how the decentralized currency\u2019s burgeoning industry could benefit U.K. households, businesses and communities. BPUK\u2019s primary objectives are to drive investment, generate and prepare students for the Bitcoin jobs of the future, raise awareness and education, and explore the use of wasted and stranded energy resources for Bitcoin mining. Freddie New, BPUK\u2019s head of policy, told Cointelegraph that \u201cthe genesis of this project was the Bitcoin Collective Conference in Edinburgh\u201d \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s largest Bitcoin conference, taking place in fall 2022 . New told Cointelegraph that most of the team had been working on Bitcoin advocacy in one way or another before the conference, \u201cbut coming together like this will enable us to formalize these efforts and focus on three key related areas.\u201d He continued: Some of the advisers and board members are familiar to Cointelegraph readers. Author and journalist DecentraSuze, whose son recently introduced Bitcoin to the classroom , is a director, while Jordan Walker, co-founder of The Bitcoin Collective , and Mark Morton are advisers. Morton\u2019s Bitcoin mining company, Scilling Digital Mining, was featured in a recent Cointelegraph mini-documentary: Walker told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is an important piece of the collective puzzle to drive Bitcoin education in the U.K.: New told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is not-for-profit. To operate, it hopes to raise funds through the community, tapping into the growing trend of funding projects with satoshis , or small amounts of BTC, via the Lightning Network, a layer-2 instant payment solution built atop Bitcoin. Part of the team\u2019s mission is to locate and harness renewable, wasted or stranded energy across the U.K., New explained. He continued with the plan: \u201cWe can then invite British policymakers to these sites so they can see mines in action and hopefully understand more about the industry\u2019s potential to mitigate vented methane, provide demand response for renewable grids, or simply act as a customer for energy that is otherwise wasted.\u201d The U.K. has burgeoning renewable energy sources but lacks in hash rate (a measure of the Bitcoin protocol\u2019s security). According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the U.K. supports 0.23% of the global monthly hash rate, compared with the United States\u2019 37.84%. This is partly due to electricity costs in the U.K. exceeding those of the U.S. and Asia, but also due to Bitcoin mining awareness \u2014 or a lack thereof \u2014 in the U.K. Moreover, legacy media platforms have taken aim at the Bitcoin mining industry in recent years \u2014 the Guardian critiqued Bitcoin as \u201cdigital beef\u201d instead of \u201cdigital gold.\u201d BPUK highlighted that in light of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union, it could develop a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency regime separate from that of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in Europe. The European parliamentary committee on MiCA may threaten Bitcoin mining on the continent . BPUK co-founder Krista Edmunds took inspiration from El Salvador\u2019s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Edmunds explained: On the governmental side, the policy group will have an opportunity to educate and inform. Lisa Cameron, a member of Parliament and chairperson of the Crypto and Digital Assets All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), told Cointelegraph in an interview last year: \u201cWe are on a learning curve, and it\u2019s just very, very important because the U.K. government has a policy vision that the U.K. will become an international hub of cryptocurrency and digital assets.\u201d She added that there was some confusion surrounding Bitcoin, central bank digital currencies and cryptocurrency. New explained that as a Bitcoin-only organization, the BPUK ultimately seeks to \u201cmake sure that Bitcoin is included in the government\u2019s proposals, if not at the front and center.\"",

                  "content": "On April 12, cryptocurrency exchange Gemini announced it filed a pre-registration undertaking with the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), which oversees capital markets in Canada's most populous province. The undertaking is a prerequisite to becoming a restricted dealer in Canada and is necessary for all cryptocurrency exchanges wishing to conduct business in the country. Cynthia Del Pozo Garcia, Gemini's director of strategy and corporate development, wrote: According to Del Pozo Garcia, Gemini holds holds \"many licenses globally,\" such as state money transmitter licenses, an E-Money License from the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom, and an E-Money License from the Central Bank of Ireland. \"Related to our licenses, Gemini must undergo annual audits of our financial statements and is subject to bank examinations conducted by the New York Department of Financial Services,\" the director said. On Feb. 22, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) published a notice requiring all crypto asset trading platforms to sign a legally binding pre-registration undertaking to continue operating in the country. Among many restrictions, exchanges will be prohibited from allowing Canadian clients to buy or deposit stablecoins without prior approval from the CSA. Since the new regulations took effect, cryptocurrency exchange OKX has announced it would cease operations in Canada by June 2023. Meanwhile, fintech company Paxos said it would withdraw from Canada , citing regulatory uncertainty. Binance and Kraken have since stated that they filed the pre-registration undertaking required to continue operations in the country. Related: OKX to cease operations in Canada by June 22, 2023",

                  "description": "BTC price continues to show strength and derivatives data suggests that bulls intend to press Bitcoin higher.",
                  "content": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) price maintained the $30,000 support as lower-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released on April 12. The official inflation rate for March increased 5% year on year, which was slightly less than the 5.1% consensus. It was the lowest reading since May 2021, but is still significantly higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The data suggests that inflation is no longer the driving force behind Bitcoin\u2019s rally and Investors' focus shifted from the impact of inflationary pressure to potential recession risks after the banking crisis revealed how fragile the financial system was following the Federal Reserve's twelve-month hike in interest rates from 0.10% to 4.85%. Aside from the Silicon Valley Bank bankruptcy and the government-backed sale of Credit Suisse to UBS, several warning signs of a macroeconomic downturn have emerged. The most recent ISM Purchasing Managers Index data fell to its lowest level since May 2020, indicating an economic contraction. According to Federal Reserve documents released on April 12, the aftermath of the U.S. banking crisis is likely to push the economy into a \"mild recession\" later this year. Because of the crisis, some have speculated that the Fed will hold off on raising interest rates, but officials affirmed that more effort is needed to keep inflation under control. According to a Moody's Analytics report, commercial real estate prices fell 1.6% in February, the most since the 2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, the national office vacancy rate reached 16.5%, indicating the severity of the economic difficulties that businesses are currently facing. Whatever the reason for Bitcoin's 50% rally between March 11 and April 11, it demonstrates resilience to FUD, including the SEC's Wells Notice against Coinbase on March 22, and the CFTC filing a suit against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao on March 27. By holding the $30,000 support, Bitcoin demonstrates that the positive momentum can continue regardless of whether inflation remains above 5%. Not everyone is cheering the rally, particularly traders who have placed bearish bets using Bitcoin options. The April 14 open interest for BTC options expiry is $950 million, with $490 million in call (buy) options and $460 million in put (sell) options. Bears have been caught off guard, with less than 7% of their bets exceeding $29,000. Below are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of call (buy) and put (sell) options contracts available on April 14 varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit: This rough estimate considers only call options in bullish bets and put options in neutral-to-bearish trades. Nonetheless, this oversimplification excludes more complex investment strategies. A trader, for example, could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a certain price, but this effect is difficult to estimate. Related: Bitcoin-friendly PPI data boosts bulls as Ether price fights for $2K Bulls are expected to push Bitcoin above $30,500 on April 14 at 8:00 a.m UTC to profit an additional $100 million. Bears, on the other hand, would need to pressure Bitcoin's price below $29,000 in order to balance the scales. However, bears have recently suffered significant losses as BTC futures short contracts were forcibly liquidated to the tune of $128 million between April 9 and April 11. As the most likely scenario favors Bitcoin bulls, their profits will most likely be used to reinforce the $30,000 support. Bears might consider licking their wounds and waiting for additional actions from regulators as the macroeconomic scenario is currently bullish for supply capped assets.

                  "description": "You might think that new tax reporting rules for exchanges should mean less work for the taxpayer, but it\u2019s the opposite, says CPA Kirk Phillips.",
                  "content": "Kirk Phillips Kirk Phillips is a CPA, entrepreneur and founder of Global Crypto Advisors and Crypto Blocko, a business, accounting and tax resource site. This article is part of CoinDesk\u2019s Tax Week series. The U.S. Infrastructure and Jobs Act ushered in \u201cbroker reporting\u201d rules for centralized crypto exchanges, effectively turning digital assets into securities for purposes of the Section 6045 reporting requirement. Stock trading firms issue tax forms 1099-Bs with sales of securities and capital gains and losses, so centralized exchanges will do the same thing for crypto trades on the new Form 1099-DA. Cash App and Robinhood Crypto, for example, have already been issuing crypto trades on 1099-Bs for several years. This article is part of CoinDesk's Tax Guide 2023 . Kirk Phillips is an entrepreneur, Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and author of \"The Ultimate Bitcoin Business Guide: For Entrepreneurs & Business Advisors.\" At first glance it might seem like crypto reporting by exchanges means less work for the taxpayer, but it\u2019s the opposite. This creates a huge burden for centralized exchanges and saddles the taxpayer with a more onerous crypto tax reporting exercise. Taxpayers in other regimes that implement similar rules will suffer the same fate. Let\u2019s dig deeper and find out why. The U.S. has a voluntary tax compliance system where the taxpayer is responsible for calculating and filing their own taxes. Taxpayers report two kinds of information: The Internal Revenue Service matches amounts reported by third parties to make sure they\u2019re the same amounts reported by the taxpayer. Third-party tax forms include W-2s, 1099s, 1098s and so on. Taxpayers self-report any income, expenses or deductions not reported on third-party forms. Both of those reporting methods were completely separate until now. Crypto tax calculations were mostly the 100% self-reported variety, but the new broker reporting rules relegate taxpayers to a combination of third-party and self-reporting, and that\u2019s where the problem begins. Taxpayers will still manage their entire view of crypto tax calculations. Meanwhile, multiple exchanges will report their tiny view of a taxpayer\u2019s crypto landscape, leaving the taxpayer to piece together 1099-DAs and figure out whether they\u2019re correct. What\u2019s been described in these pages as \u201c The Maddening Task of Calculating Crypto Taxes \u201d is the first clue the new reporting rules will create more crypto tax headaches, not less. Taxpayers can easily rack up five to 10 times more wallets and exchange accounts than stock trading and bank accounts while having to untangle a web of crypto transactions contained within. Most crypto tax software providers deployed the universal cost basis feature that dumps all transactions into a single bucket for calculation purposes. Alice (not her real name!) has been in crypto for six years and accumulated seven exchange accounts and 13 wallets. The software commingles all her transactions from 2018 up to the current year and makes one calculation as if Alice was only using one wallet. Under the new rules, Alice would receive seven 1099-DAs in addition to her own universal calculation. Alice is no longer solely responsible for her crypto tax calculations and instead has eight parties, including herself, in on the calculation exercise. Alice has been calculating and self-reporting her crypto taxes on Form 8949 for years. She disregards the seven 1099-DAs because she\u2019s already included all her transactions in the current Form 8949. Alice files her tax return as usual and gets flustered after receiving an IRS notice saying she underreported income. Now Alice must amend her tax return and report the information as received on the 1099-DAs. Bob, on the other hand, has eight wallets and four exchange accounts. He reported four 1099-DAs on his tax return and deleted the transactions for those four exchanges from his crypto tax software. Bob thought this was a clever solution to avoid double-counting his exchange transactions, but he didn\u2019t realize two of the exchanges didn\u2019t report cost basis on 1099-DAs. As a result, he overstated his capital gains and significantly overpaid more tax than he should have. Bob and Alice have run headfirst into some of the numerous 1099-DA pitfalls. Now they must go through a rigorous exercise to reconcile all the 1099-DAs with their own universal calculation to double-check the exchanges correctly reported information. The challenge of managing crypto taxes just got magnified. In the absence of a thorough reconciliation and cross-checking exercise, taxpayers will otherwise double count and/or omit cost basis and therefore understate or overstate tax liabilities. Let\u2019s look at some other 1099-DA pitfalls. U.S. taxpayers can use FIFO, first in first out, or specific identification for crypto cost-basis methods just like securities sales. FIFO is simply a tracking method where the oldest crypto purchased is considered the first crypto sold and specific identification allows taxpayers to choose a specific batch of crypto to sell before selling it. In legacy finance, a taxpayer can give notice to their securities broker to use specific identification and then instruct the broker which tax lot of securities to sell. Specific identification doesn\u2019t work this way in crypto because both exchanges and crypto tax software don\u2019t provide any pre-sale identifying mechanisms. This means exchanges will default to providing FIFO-only cost basis on 1099-DAs. Meanwhile, taxpayers use several cost method methods, numerous other ways crypto is considered sold for tax purposes, as proxies for specific identification because the cost basis in the calculation is \u201cidentified\u201d after the sale instead of before. Nonetheless, if exchanges report on a FIFO basis and the taxpayer uses specific identification, then reconciling between the two will be impossible. This illustrates how cost basis would be double counted and/or omitted because the taxpayers and exchanges are using inconsistent cost basis methods. Cost-basis tracking on a per-wallet and exchange basis would help the reconciliation process but doesn\u2019t come without its own issues. Several crypto tax software providers, such as Cointracker and Bitwave, are rolling out per-wallet and exchange tracking and some already had these features. Alice has consistently used the FIFO cost basis method and wants to reconcile her 1099-DAs so she switches her crypto software from universal to per-wallet tracking. She\u2019s surprised to get different gains and losses for each tax year, but her new CPA explains the calculations go back to 2018 and the per-wallet method is recalculating what has already been calculated in prior years. Crypto software must lock down cost basis at the end of 2022, for example, so the shift to per wallet tracking avoids the double-counting and/or omissions dilemma. It\u2019s unclear how exchanges are going to manage customer basis and data tracking because 1099-DA reporting is currently deferred until final regulations are issued. One thing is clear, though \u2013 there will be differences and taxpayers will have extra work to correctly adjust gains and losses on their tax returns. Form 8949, used to report the detail all crypto trades, has adjustment codes to deal with incorrectly reported basis and other issues. However, this is easier said than done. In addition to the normal crypto tax headaches, taxpayers must track 1099-DA reconciliation differences, calculate adjustments and figure out reporting so final gains and losses are correct. There are also many other issues too numerous to mention here. Bob, a decentralized finance (DeFi) degen, wants to avoid the 1099-DA conundrums and decided to use his centralized exchanges as stablecoin-only on- and off-ramps and use DeFi protocols for all his other crypto activity. His 1099-DAs would only show stablecoin sales with gains and losses essentially zero, thus eliminating the reconciliation and adjustment exercise. Bob is going to minimize transfers among exchanges to keep activity as self-contained as possible. He\u2019s also considering opening new exchange accounts to containerize new trades and cost basis when 1099-DAs are finally issued. We need crypto tax management to get easier, not harder. The ideal compromise for final broker reporting rules would be removing the cost basis reporting requirement to eliminate most of the cost basis reconciliation headaches. Then taxpayers would only have to deal with reconciling reported proceeds from trades. Fortunately, the delay with 1099-DA will give more time for exchanges to develop better reporting, crypto tax software providers to develop more useful tracking features and taxpayers to strategize ways to minimize headaches.

The legal team also reported in a March 20 filing that one of Armstrong\u2019s voicemails included the YouTuber allegedly threatening to surround Moskowitz\u2019s home with protesters \u201c24/7 day and night.\u201d \u201cThe scope of the attacks (including death threats), which examples are provided in those filings and which continue on a daily basis since, necessitated Undersigned Counsel to open an FBI investigation into Armstrong, as well as the investigation files by local police authorities for Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and their families,\u201d said Moskowitz. Twitter posts from Armstrong claimed the original lawsuit regarding disclosure of compensation from FTX had \u201cabsolutely no merit.\u201d The crypto influencer is no stranger to online controversy, regularly insulting high-profile figures, including European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde and being generally dismissive of the class-action lawsuit. So let me get this straight\u2026 Adam Moskowitz frivolously attaches me falsely as a paid promoter of FTX, a site where people lot EVERYTHING\u2026 many lost life savings. Many on brink of suicide. And this fragile pussy claims he is the one scared and at risk because I call him names. Related: YouTube appoints Web3-friendly exec as new CEO In August 2022, Armstrong filed a defamation suit against YouTuber Erling Mengshoel Jr. \u2014 also known as Atozy \u2014 in response to a video Mengshoel posted claiming that \u201cThis YouTuber scams his fans\u2026 Bitboy Crypto.\u201d Armstrong dropped the lawsuit after Mengshoel raised more than $200,000 in a campaign for his defense in less than 24 hours.

                  "content": "God save our gracious coin, and long live the coin. A team of entrepreneurs, environmentalists and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have assembled to back Bitcoin in Britain. Bitcoin Policy UK (BPUK) unites stakeholders, policymakers, environmentalists, tax specialists, Bitcoin experts and miners to \u201cunlock the potential of Bitcoin\u201d in Britain and explore how the decentralized currency\u2019s burgeoning industry could benefit U.K. households, businesses and communities. BPUK\u2019s primary objectives are to drive investment, generate and prepare students for the Bitcoin jobs of the future, raise awareness and education, and explore the use of wasted and stranded energy resources for Bitcoin mining. Freddie New, BPUK\u2019s head of policy, told Cointelegraph that \u201cthe genesis of this project was the Bitcoin Collective Conference in Edinburgh\u201d \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s largest Bitcoin conference, taking place in fall 2022 . New told Cointelegraph that most of the team had been working on Bitcoin advocacy in one way or another before the conference, \u201cbut coming together like this will enable us to formalize these efforts and focus on three key related areas.\u201d He continued: Some of the advisers and board members are familiar to Cointelegraph readers. Author and journalist DecentraSuze, whose son recently introduced Bitcoin to the classroom , is a director, while Jordan Walker, co-founder of The Bitcoin Collective , and Mark Morton are advisers. Morton\u2019s Bitcoin mining company, Scilling Digital Mining, was featured in a recent Cointelegraph mini-documentary: Walker told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is an important piece of the collective puzzle to drive Bitcoin education in the U.K.: New told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is not-for-profit. To operate, it hopes to raise funds through the community, tapping into the growing trend of funding projects with satoshis , or small amounts of BTC, via the Lightning Network, a layer-2 instant payment solution built atop Bitcoin. Part of the team\u2019s mission is to locate and harness renewable, wasted or stranded energy across the U.K., New explained. He continued with the plan: \u201cWe can then invite British policymakers to these sites so they can see mines in action and hopefully understand more about the industry\u2019s potential to mitigate vented methane, provide demand response for renewable grids, or simply act as a customer for energy that is otherwise wasted.\u201d The U.K. has burgeoning renewable energy sources but lacks in hash rate (a measure of the Bitcoin protocol\u2019s security). According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the U.K. supports 0.23% of the global monthly hash rate, compared with the United States\u2019 37.84%. This is partly due to electricity costs in the U.K. exceeding those of the U.S. and Asia, but also due to Bitcoin mining awareness \u2014 or a lack thereof \u2014 in the U.K. Moreover, legacy media platforms have taken aim at the Bitcoin mining industry in recent years \u2014 the Guardian critiqued Bitcoin as \u201cdigital beef\u201d instead of \u201cdigital gold.\u201d BPUK highlighted that in light of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union, it could develop a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency regime separate from that of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in Europe. The European parliamentary committee on MiCA may threaten Bitcoin mining on the continent . BPUK co-founder Krista Edmunds took inspiration from El Salvador\u2019s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Edmunds explained: On the governmental side, the policy group will have an opportunity to educate and inform. Lisa Cameron, a member of Parliament and chairperson of the Crypto and Digital Assets All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), told Cointelegraph in an interview last year: \u201cWe are on a learning curve, and it\u2019s just very, very important because the U.K. government has a policy vision that the U.K. will become an international hub of cryptocurrency and digital assets.\u201d She added that there was some confusion surrounding Bitcoin, central bank digital currencies and cryptocurrency. New explained that as a Bitcoin-only organization, the BPUK ultimately seeks to \u201cmake sure that Bitcoin is included in the government\u2019s proposals, if not at the front and center.\"",

The undertaking is a prerequisite to becoming a restricted dealer in Canada and is necessary for all cryptocurrency exchanges wishing to conduct business in the country. Cynthia Del Pozo Garcia, Gemini's director of strategy and corporate development, wrote: According to Del Pozo Garcia, Gemini holds holds \"many licenses globally,\" such as state money transmitter licenses, an E-Money License from the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom, and an E-Money License from the Central Bank of Ireland. \"Related to our licenses, Gemini must undergo annual audits of our financial statements and is subject to bank examinations conducted by the New York Department of Financial Services,\" the director said. On Feb. 22, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) published a notice requiring all crypto asset trading platforms to sign a legally binding pre-registration undertaking to continue operating in the country. Among many restrictions, exchanges will be prohibited from allowing Canadian clients to buy or deposit stablecoins without prior approval from the CSA. Since the new regulations took effect, cryptocurrency exchange OKX has announced it would cease operations in Canada by June 2023. Meanwhile, fintech company Paxos said it would withdraw from Canada , citing regulatory uncertainty. Binance and Kraken have since stated that they filed the pre-registration undertaking required to continue operations in the country. Related: OKX to cease operations in Canada by June 22, 2023",

                  "content": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) price maintained the $30,000 support as lower-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released on April 12. The official inflation rate for March increased 5% year on year, which was slightly less than the 5.1% consensus. It was the lowest reading since May 2021, but is still significantly higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The data suggests that inflation is no longer the driving force behind Bitcoin\u2019s rally and Investors' focus shifted from the impact of inflationary pressure to potential recession risks after the banking crisis revealed how fragile the financial system was following the Federal Reserve's twelve-month hike in interest rates from 0.10% to 4.85%. Aside from the Silicon Valley Bank bankruptcy and the government-backed sale of Credit Suisse to UBS, several warning signs of a macroeconomic downturn have emerged. The most recent ISM Purchasing Managers Index data fell to its lowest level since May 2020, indicating an economic contraction. According to Federal Reserve documents released on April 12, the aftermath of the U.S. banking crisis is likely to push the economy into a \"mild recession\" later this year. Because of the crisis, some have speculated that the Fed will hold off on raising interest rates, but officials affirmed that more effort is needed to keep inflation under control. According to a Moody's Analytics report, commercial real estate prices fell 1.6% in February, the most since the 2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, the national office vacancy rate reached 16.5%, indicating the severity of the economic difficulties that businesses are currently facing. Whatever the reason for Bitcoin's 50% rally between March 11 and April 11, it demonstrates resilience to FUD, including the SEC's Wells Notice against Coinbase on March 22, and the CFTC filing a suit against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao on March 27. By holding the $30,000 support, Bitcoin demonstrates that the positive momentum can continue regardless of whether inflation remains above 5%. Not everyone is cheering the rally, particularly traders who have placed bearish bets using Bitcoin options. The April 14 open interest for BTC options expiry is $950 million, with $490 million in call (buy) options and $460 million in put (sell) options. Bears have been caught off guard, with less than 7% of their bets exceeding $29,000. Below are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of call (buy) and put (sell) options contracts available on April 14 varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit: This rough estimate considers only call options in bullish bets and put options in neutral-to-bearish trades. Nonetheless, this oversimplification excludes more complex investment strategies. A trader, for example, could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a certain price, but this effect is difficult to estimate.

Bears, on the other hand, would need to pressure Bitcoin's price below $29,000 in order to balance the scales. However, bears have recently suffered significant losses as BTC futures short contracts were forcibly liquidated to the tune of $128 million between April 9 and April 11. As the most likely scenario favors Bitcoin bulls, their profits will most likely be used to reinforce the $30,000 support. Bears might consider licking their wounds and waiting for additional actions from regulators as the macroeconomic scenario is currently bullish for supply capped assets.

                  "content": "Kirk Phillips Kirk Phillips is a CPA, entrepreneur and founder of Global Crypto Advisors and Crypto Blocko, a business, accounting and tax resource site. This article is part of CoinDesk\u2019s Tax Week series. The U.S. Infrastructure and Jobs Act ushered in \u201cbroker reporting\u201d rules for centralized crypto exchanges, effectively turning digital assets into securities for purposes of the Section 6045 reporting requirement. Stock trading firms issue tax forms 1099-Bs with sales of securities and capital gains and losses, so centralized exchanges will do the same thing for crypto trades on the new Form 1099-DA. Cash App and Robinhood Crypto, for example, have already been issuing crypto trades on 1099-Bs for several years. This article is part of CoinDesk's Tax Guide 2023 . Kirk Phillips is an entrepreneur, Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and author of \"The Ultimate Bitcoin Business Guide: For Entrepreneurs & Business Advisors.\" At first glance it might seem like crypto reporting by exchanges means less work for the taxpayer, but it\u2019s the opposite. This creates a huge burden for centralized exchanges and saddles the taxpayer with a more onerous crypto tax reporting exercise. Taxpayers in other regimes that implement similar rules will suffer the same fate. Let\u2019s dig deeper and find out why. The U.S. has a voluntary tax compliance system where the taxpayer is responsible for calculating and filing their own taxes. Taxpayers report two kinds of information: The Internal Revenue Service matches amounts reported by third parties to make sure they\u2019re the same amounts reported by the taxpayer. Third-party tax forms include W-2s, 1099s, 1098s and so on. Taxpayers self-report any income, expenses or deductions not reported on third-party forms. Both of those reporting methods were completely separate until now. Crypto tax calculations were mostly the 100% self-reported variety, but the new broker reporting rules relegate taxpayers to a combination of third-party and self-reporting, and that\u2019s where the problem begins. Taxpayers will still manage their entire view of crypto tax calculations. Meanwhile, multiple exchanges will report their tiny view of a taxpayer\u2019s crypto landscape, leaving the taxpayer to piece together 1099-DAs and figure out whether they\u2019re correct. What\u2019s been described in these pages as \u201c The Maddening Task of Calculating Crypto Taxes \u201d is the first clue the new reporting rules will create more crypto tax headaches, not less. Taxpayers can easily rack up five to 10 times more wallets and exchange accounts than stock trading and bank accounts while having to untangle a web of crypto transactions contained within. Most crypto tax software providers deployed the universal cost basis feature that dumps all transactions into a single bucket for calculation purposes. Alice (not her real name!) has been in crypto for six years and accumulated seven exchange accounts and 13 wallets. The software commingles all her transactions from 2018 up to the current year and makes one calculation as if Alice was only using one wallet. Under the new rules, Alice would receive seven 1099-DAs in addition to her own universal calculation. Alice is no longer solely responsible for her crypto tax calculations and instead has eight parties, including herself, in on the calculation exercise. Alice has been calculating and self-reporting her crypto taxes on Form 8949 for years. She disregards the seven 1099-DAs because she\u2019s already included all her transactions in the current Form 8949. Alice files her tax return as usual and gets flustered after receiving an IRS notice saying she underreported income. Now Alice must amend her tax return and report the information as received on the 1099-DAs. Bob, on the other hand, has eight wallets and four exchange accounts. He reported four 1099-DAs on his tax return and deleted the transactions for those four exchanges from his crypto tax software. Bob thought this was a clever solution to avoid double-counting his exchange transactions, but he didn\u2019t realize two of the exchanges didn\u2019t report cost basis on 1099-DAs. As a result, he overstated his capital gains and significantly overpaid more tax than he should have. Bob and Alice have run headfirst into some of the numerous 1099-DA pitfalls. Now they must go through a rigorous exercise to reconcile all the 1099-DAs with their own universal calculation to double-check the exchanges correctly reported information. The challenge of managing crypto taxes just got magnified. In the absence of a thorough reconciliation and cross-checking exercise, taxpayers will otherwise double count and/or omit cost basis and therefore understate or overstate tax liabilities. Let\u2019s look at some other 1099-DA pitfalls. U.S. taxpayers can use FIFO, first in first out, or specific identification for crypto cost-basis methods just like securities sales. FIFO is simply a tracking method where the oldest crypto purchased is considered the first crypto sold and specific identification allows taxpayers to choose a specific batch of crypto to sell before selling it. In legacy finance, a taxpayer can give notice to their securities broker to use specific identification and then instruct the broker which tax lot of securities to sell. Specific identification doesn\u2019t work this way in crypto because both exchanges and crypto tax software don\u2019t provide any pre-sale identifying mechanisms. This means exchanges will default to providing FIFO-only cost basis on 1099-DAs. Meanwhile, taxpayers use several cost method methods, numerous other ways crypto is considered sold for tax purposes, as proxies for specific identification because the cost basis in the calculation is \u201cidentified\u201d after the sale instead of before. Nonetheless, if exchanges report on a FIFO basis and the taxpayer uses specific identification, then reconciling between the two will be impossible. This illustrates how cost basis would be double counted and/or omitted because the taxpayers and exchanges are using inconsistent cost basis methods. Cost-basis tracking on a per-wallet and exchange basis would help the reconciliation process but doesn\u2019t come without its own issues. Several crypto tax software providers, such as Cointracker and Bitwave, are rolling out per-wallet and exchange tracking and some already had these features. Alice has consistently used the FIFO cost basis method and wants to reconcile her 1099-DAs so she switches her crypto software from universal to per-wallet tracking. She\u2019s surprised to get different gains and losses for each tax year, but her new CPA explains the calculations go back to 2018 and the per-wallet method is recalculating what has already been calculated in prior years. Crypto software must lock down cost basis at the end of 2022, for example, so the shift to per wallet tracking avoids the double-counting and/or omissions dilemma. It\u2019s unclear how exchanges are going to manage customer basis and data tracking because 1099-DA reporting is currently deferred until final regulations are issued. One thing is clear, though \u2013 there will be differences and taxpayers will have extra work to correctly adjust gains and losses on their tax returns. Form 8949, used to report the detail all crypto trades, has adjustment codes to deal with incorrectly reported basis and other issues. However, this is easier said than done. In addition to the normal crypto tax headaches, taxpayers must track 1099-DA reconciliation differences, calculate adjustments and figure out reporting so final gains and losses are correct. There are also many other issues too numerous to mention here. Bob, a decentralized finance (DeFi) degen, wants to avoid the 1099-DA conundrums and decided to use his centralized exchanges as stablecoin-only on- and off-ramps and use DeFi protocols for all his other crypto activity. His 1099-DAs would only show stablecoin sales with gains and losses essentially zero, thus eliminating the reconciliation and adjustment exercise. Bob is going to minimize transfers among exchanges to keep activity as self-contained as possible. He\u2019s also considering opening new exchange accounts to containerize new trades and cost basis when 1099-DAs are finally issued. We need crypto tax management to get easier, not harder. The ideal compromise for final broker reporting rules would be removing the cost basis reporting requirement to eliminate most of the cost basis reconciliation headaches. Then taxpayers would only have to deal with reconciling reported proceeds from trades. Fortunately, the delay with 1099-DA will give more time for exchanges to develop better reporting, crypto tax software providers to develop more useful tracking features and taxpayers to strategize ways to minimize headaches.

                  "content": "A federal magistrate judge has signed an order requiring BitBoy Crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong to appear in Florida as part of a status conference related to a lawsuit involving several crypto influencers. In an April 12 filing in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Judge Melissa Damian ordered Armstrong and his counsel to appear on April 20 along with the legal team representing the influencers. According to the order, the conference was aimed at bringing awareness of \u201cArmstrong\u2019s harassment towards plaintiffs\u2019 counsel.\u201d Armstrong, along with several other YouTubers, were named in a $1-billion lawsuit filed on March 15 for allegedly promoting \u201cFTX crypto fraud without disclosing compensation.\u201d Adam Moskowitz, representing plaintiff Edwin Garrison and others in the class-action lawsuit, has claimed that Armstrong harassed the legal team with \u201cendless phone calls, tweets and emails,\u201d voicemails \u201cfull of vulgarities,\u201d and social media posts suggesting threats. An April 5 filing showing cause for a hearing with Armstrong detailed \u201cdaily violent threats\u201d by the YouTuber in addition to responses to emails with threats and insults before being served with process papers. The legal team also reported in a March 20 filing that one of Armstrong\u2019s voicemails included the YouTuber allegedly threatening to surround Moskowitz\u2019s home with protesters \u201c24/7 day and night.\u201d \u201cThe scope of the attacks (including death threats), which examples are provided in those filings and which continue on a daily basis since, necessitated Undersigned Counsel to open an FBI investigation into Armstrong, as well as the investigation files by local police authorities for Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and their families,\u201d said Moskowitz. Twitter posts from Armstrong claimed the original lawsuit regarding disclosure of compensation from FTX had \u201cabsolutely no merit.\u201d The crypto influencer is no stranger to online controversy, regularly insulting high-profile figures, including European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde and being generally dismissive of the class-action lawsuit. So let me get this straight\u2026 Adam Moskowitz frivolously attaches me falsely as a paid promoter of FTX, a site where people lot EVERYTHING\u2026 many lost life savings. Many on brink of suicide.

                  "content": "God save our gracious coin, and long live the coin. A team of entrepreneurs, environmentalists and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have assembled to back Bitcoin in Britain. Bitcoin Policy UK (BPUK) unites stakeholders, policymakers, environmentalists, tax specialists, Bitcoin experts and miners to \u201cunlock the potential of Bitcoin\u201d in Britain and explore how the decentralized currency\u2019s burgeoning industry could benefit U.K. households, businesses and communities. BPUK\u2019s primary objectives are to drive investment, generate and prepare students for the Bitcoin jobs of the future, raise awareness and education, and explore the use of wasted and stranded energy resources for Bitcoin mining. Freddie New, BPUK\u2019s head of policy, told Cointelegraph that \u201cthe genesis of this project was the Bitcoin Collective Conference in Edinburgh\u201d \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s largest Bitcoin conference, taking place in fall 2022 . New told Cointelegraph that most of the team had been working on Bitcoin advocacy in one way or another before the conference, \u201cbut coming together like this will enable us to formalize these efforts and focus on three key related areas.\u201d He continued: Some of the advisers and board members are familiar to Cointelegraph readers. Author and journalist DecentraSuze, whose son recently introduced Bitcoin to the classroom , is a director, while Jordan Walker, co-founder of The Bitcoin Collective , and Mark Morton are advisers. Morton\u2019s Bitcoin mining company, Scilling Digital Mining, was featured in a recent Cointelegraph mini-documentary: Walker told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is an important piece of the collective puzzle to drive Bitcoin education in the U.K.: New told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is not-for-profit. To operate, it hopes to raise funds through the community, tapping into the growing trend of funding projects with satoshis , or small amounts of BTC, via the Lightning Network, a layer-2 instant payment solution built atop Bitcoin. Part of the team\u2019s mission is to locate and harness renewable, wasted or stranded energy across the U.K., New explained. He continued with the plan: \u201cWe can then invite British policymakers to these sites so they can see mines in action and hopefully understand more about the industry\u2019s potential to mitigate vented methane, provide demand response for renewable grids, or simply act as a customer for energy that is otherwise wasted.\u201d The U.K. has burgeoning renewable energy sources but lacks in hash rate (a measure of the Bitcoin protocol\u2019s security). According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the U.K. supports 0.23% of the global monthly hash rate, compared with the United States\u2019 37.84%. This is partly due to electricity costs in the U.K. exceeding those of the U.S. and Asia, but also due to Bitcoin mining awareness \u2014 or a lack thereof \u2014 in the U.K. Moreover, legacy media platforms have taken aim at the Bitcoin mining industry in recent years \u2014 the Guardian critiqued Bitcoin as \u201cdigital beef\u201d instead of \u201cdigital gold.\u201d BPUK highlighted that in light of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union, it could develop a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency regime separate from that of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in Europe. The European parliamentary committee on MiCA may threaten Bitcoin mining on the continent . BPUK co-founder Krista Edmunds took inspiration from El Salvador\u2019s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Edmunds explained: On the governmental side, the policy group will have an opportunity to educate and inform. Lisa Cameron, a member of Parliament and chairperson of the Crypto and Digital Assets All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), told Cointelegraph in an interview last year: \u201cWe are on a learning curve, and it\u2019s just very, very important because the U.K. government has a policy vision that the U.K. will become an international hub of cryptocurrency and digital assets.\u201d She added that there was some confusion surrounding Bitcoin, central bank digital currencies and cryptocurrency. New explained that as a Bitcoin-only organization, the BPUK ultimately seeks to \u201cmake sure that Bitcoin is included in the government\u2019s proposals, if not at the front and center.\"",

The undertaking is a prerequisite to becoming a restricted dealer in Canada and is necessary for all cryptocurrency exchanges wishing to conduct business in the country. Cynthia Del Pozo Garcia, Gemini's director of strategy and corporate development, wrote: According to Del Pozo Garcia, Gemini holds holds \"many licenses globally,\" such as state money transmitter licenses, an E-Money License from the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom, and an E-Money License from the Central Bank of Ireland. \"Related to our licenses, Gemini must undergo annual audits of our financial statements and is subject to bank examinations conducted by the New York Department of Financial Services,\" the director said. On Feb. 22, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) published a notice requiring all crypto asset trading platforms to sign a legally binding pre-registration undertaking to continue operating in the country. Among many restrictions, exchanges will be prohibited from allowing Canadian clients to buy or deposit stablecoins without prior approval from the CSA. Since the new regulations took effect, cryptocurrency exchange OKX has announced it would cease operations in Canada by June 2023. Meanwhile, fintech company Paxos said it would withdraw from Canada , citing regulatory uncertainty. Binance and Kraken have since stated that they filed the pre-registration undertaking required to continue operations in the country. Related: OKX to cease operations in Canada by June 22, 2023",

                  "description": "BTC price continues to show strength and derivatives data suggests that bulls intend to press Bitcoin higher.",
                  "content": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) price maintained the $30,000 support as lower-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released on April 12. The official inflation rate for March increased 5% year on year, which was slightly less than the 5.1% consensus. It was the lowest reading since May 2021, but is still significantly higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The data suggests that inflation is no longer the driving force behind Bitcoin\u2019s rally and Investors' focus shifted from the impact of inflationary pressure to potential recession risks after the banking crisis revealed how fragile the financial system was following the Federal Reserve's twelve-month hike in interest rates from 0.10% to 4.85%. Aside from the Silicon Valley Bank bankruptcy and the government-backed sale of Credit Suisse to UBS, several warning signs of a macroeconomic downturn have emerged. The most recent ISM Purchasing Managers Index data fell to its lowest level since May 2020, indicating an economic contraction. According to Federal Reserve documents released on April 12, the aftermath of the U.S. banking crisis is likely to push the economy into a \"mild recession\" later this year. Because of the crisis, some have speculated that the Fed will hold off on raising interest rates, but officials affirmed that more effort is needed to keep inflation under control. According to a Moody's Analytics report, commercial real estate prices fell 1.6% in February, the most since the 2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, the national office vacancy rate reached 16.5%, indicating the severity of the economic difficulties that businesses are currently facing. Whatever the reason for Bitcoin's 50% rally between March 11 and April 11, it demonstrates resilience to FUD, including the SEC's Wells Notice against Coinbase on March 22, and the CFTC filing a suit against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao on March 27. By holding the $30,000 support, Bitcoin demonstrates that the positive momentum can continue regardless of whether inflation remains above 5%. Not everyone is cheering the rally, particularly traders who have placed bearish bets using Bitcoin options. The April 14 open interest for BTC options expiry is $950 million, with $490 million in call (buy) options and $460 million in put (sell) options. Bears have been caught off guard, with less than 7% of their bets exceeding $29,000. Below are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of call (buy) and put (sell) options contracts available on April 14 varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit: This rough estimate considers only call options in bullish bets and put options in neutral-to-bearish trades. Nonetheless, this oversimplification excludes more complex investment strategies. A trader, for example, could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a certain price, but this effect is difficult to estimate. Related: Bitcoin-friendly PPI data boosts bulls as Ether price fights for $2K Bulls are expected to push Bitcoin above $30,500 on April 14 at 8:00 a.m UTC to profit an additional $100 million. Bears, on the other hand, would need to pressure Bitcoin's price below $29,000 in order to balance the scales. However, bears have recently suffered significant losses as BTC futures short contracts were forcibly liquidated to the tune of $128 million between April 9 and April 11. As the most likely scenario favors Bitcoin bulls, their profits will most likely be used to reinforce the $30,000 support. Bears might consider licking their wounds and waiting for additional actions from regulators as the macroeconomic scenario is currently bullish for supply capped assets.

                  "description": "You might think that new tax reporting rules for exchanges should mean less work for the taxpayer, but it\u2019s the opposite, says CPA Kirk Phillips.",
                  "content": "Kirk Phillips Kirk Phillips is a CPA, entrepreneur and founder of Global Crypto Advisors and Crypto Blocko, a business, accounting and tax resource site. This article is part of CoinDesk\u2019s Tax Week series. The U.S. Infrastructure and Jobs Act ushered in \u201cbroker reporting\u201d rules for centralized crypto exchanges, effectively turning digital assets into securities for purposes of the Section 6045 reporting requirement. Stock trading firms issue tax forms 1099-Bs with sales of securities and capital gains and losses, so centralized exchanges will do the same thing for crypto trades on the new Form 1099-DA. Cash App and Robinhood Crypto, for example, have already been issuing crypto trades on 1099-Bs for several years. This article is part of CoinDesk's Tax Guide 2023 . Kirk Phillips is an entrepreneur, Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and author of \"The Ultimate Bitcoin Business Guide: For Entrepreneurs & Business Advisors.\" At first glance it might seem like crypto reporting by exchanges means less work for the taxpayer, but it\u2019s the opposite. This creates a huge burden for centralized exchanges and saddles the taxpayer with a more onerous crypto tax reporting exercise. Taxpayers in other regimes that implement similar rules will suffer the same fate. Let\u2019s dig deeper and find out why. The U.S. has a voluntary tax compliance system where the taxpayer is responsible for calculating and filing their own taxes. Taxpayers report two kinds of information: The Internal Revenue Service matches amounts reported by third parties to make sure they\u2019re the same amounts reported by the taxpayer. Third-party tax forms include W-2s, 1099s, 1098s and so on. Taxpayers self-report any income, expenses or deductions not reported on third-party forms. Both of those reporting methods were completely separate until now. Crypto tax calculations were mostly the 100% self-reported variety, but the new broker reporting rules relegate taxpayers to a combination of third-party and self-reporting, and that\u2019s where the problem begins. Taxpayers will still manage their entire view of crypto tax calculations. Meanwhile, multiple exchanges will report their tiny view of a taxpayer\u2019s crypto landscape, leaving the taxpayer to piece together 1099-DAs and figure out whether they\u2019re correct. What\u2019s been described in these pages as \u201c The Maddening Task of Calculating Crypto Taxes \u201d is the first clue the new reporting rules will create more crypto tax headaches, not less. Taxpayers can easily rack up five to 10 times more wallets and exchange accounts than stock trading and bank accounts while having to untangle a web of crypto transactions contained within. Most crypto tax software providers deployed the universal cost basis feature that dumps all transactions into a single bucket for calculation purposes. Alice (not her real name!) has been in crypto for six years and accumulated seven exchange accounts and 13 wallets. The software commingles all her transactions from 2018 up to the current year and makes one calculation as if Alice was only using one wallet. Under the new rules, Alice would receive seven 1099-DAs in addition to her own universal calculation. Alice is no longer solely responsible for her crypto tax calculations and instead has eight parties, including herself, in on the calculation exercise. Alice has been calculating and self-reporting her crypto taxes on Form 8949 for years. She disregards the seven 1099-DAs because she\u2019s already included all her transactions in the current Form 8949. Alice files her tax return as usual and gets flustered after receiving an IRS notice saying she underreported income. Now Alice must amend her tax return and report the information as received on the 1099-DAs. Bob, on the other hand, has eight wallets and four exchange accounts. He reported four 1099-DAs on his tax return and deleted the transactions for those four exchanges from his crypto tax software. Bob thought this was a clever solution to avoid double-counting his exchange transactions, but he didn\u2019t realize two of the exchanges didn\u2019t report cost basis on 1099-DAs. As a result, he overstated his capital gains and significantly overpaid more tax than he should have. Bob and Alice have run headfirst into some of the numerous 1099-DA pitfalls. Now they must go through a rigorous exercise to reconcile all the 1099-DAs with their own universal calculation to double-check the exchanges correctly reported information. The challenge of managing crypto taxes just got magnified. In the absence of a thorough reconciliation and cross-checking exercise, taxpayers will otherwise double count and/or omit cost basis and therefore understate or overstate tax liabilities. Let\u2019s look at some other 1099-DA pitfalls. U.S. taxpayers can use FIFO, first in first out, or specific identification for crypto cost-basis methods just like securities sales. FIFO is simply a tracking method where the oldest crypto purchased is considered the first crypto sold and specific identification allows taxpayers to choose a specific batch of crypto to sell before selling it. In legacy finance, a taxpayer can give notice to their securities broker to use specific identification and then instruct the broker which tax lot of securities to sell. Specific identification doesn\u2019t work this way in crypto because both exchanges and crypto tax software don\u2019t provide any pre-sale identifying mechanisms. This means exchanges will default to providing FIFO-only cost basis on 1099-DAs. Meanwhile, taxpayers use several cost method methods, numerous other ways crypto is considered sold for tax purposes, as proxies for specific identification because the cost basis in the calculation is \u201cidentified\u201d after the sale instead of before. Nonetheless, if exchanges report on a FIFO basis and the taxpayer uses specific identification, then reconciling between the two will be impossible. This illustrates how cost basis would be double counted and/or omitted because the taxpayers and exchanges are using inconsistent cost basis methods. Cost-basis tracking on a per-wallet and exchange basis would help the reconciliation process but doesn\u2019t come without its own issues. Several crypto tax software providers, such as Cointracker and Bitwave, are rolling out per-wallet and exchange tracking and some already had these features. Alice has consistently used the FIFO cost basis method and wants to reconcile her 1099-DAs so she switches her crypto software from universal to per-wallet tracking. She\u2019s surprised to get different gains and losses for each tax year, but her new CPA explains the calculations go back to 2018 and the per-wallet method is recalculating what has already been calculated in prior years. Crypto software must lock down cost basis at the end of 2022, for example, so the shift to per wallet tracking avoids the double-counting and/or omissions dilemma. It\u2019s unclear how exchanges are going to manage customer basis and data tracking because 1099-DA reporting is currently deferred until final regulations are issued. One thing is clear, though \u2013 there will be differences and taxpayers will have extra work to correctly adjust gains and losses on their tax returns. Form 8949, used to report the detail all crypto trades, has adjustment codes to deal with incorrectly reported basis and other issues. However, this is easier said than done. In addition to the normal crypto tax headaches, taxpayers must track 1099-DA reconciliation differences, calculate adjustments and figure out reporting so final gains and losses are correct. There are also many other issues too numerous to mention here. Bob, a decentralized finance (DeFi) degen, wants to avoid the 1099-DA conundrums and decided to use his centralized exchanges as stablecoin-only on- and off-ramps and use DeFi protocols for all his other crypto activity. His 1099-DAs would only show stablecoin sales with gains and losses essentially zero, thus eliminating the reconciliation and adjustment exercise. Bob is going to minimize transfers among exchanges to keep activity as self-contained as possible. He\u2019s also considering opening new exchange accounts to containerize new trades and cost basis when 1099-DAs are finally issued. We need crypto tax management to get easier, not harder. The ideal compromise for final broker reporting rules would be removing the cost basis reporting requirement to eliminate most of the cost basis reconciliation headaches. Then taxpayers would only have to deal with reconciling reported proceeds from trades. Fortunately, the delay with 1099-DA will give more time for exchanges to develop better reporting, crypto tax software providers to develop more useful tracking features and taxpayers to strategize ways to minimize headaches.

                  "content": "A federal magistrate judge has signed an order requiring BitBoy Crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong to appear in Florida as part of a status conference related to a lawsuit involving several crypto influencers. In an April 12 filing in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Judge Melissa Damian ordered Armstrong and his counsel to appear on April 20 along with the legal team representing the influencers. According to the order, the conference was aimed at bringing awareness of \u201cArmstrong\u2019s harassment towards plaintiffs\u2019 counsel.\u201d Armstrong, along with several other YouTubers, were named in a $1-billion lawsuit filed on March 15 for allegedly promoting \u201cFTX crypto fraud without disclosing compensation.\u201d Adam Moskowitz, representing plaintiff Edwin Garrison and others in the class-action lawsuit, has claimed that Armstrong harassed the legal team with \u201cendless phone calls, tweets and emails,\u201d voicemails \u201cfull of vulgarities,\u201d and social media posts suggesting threats. An April 5 filing showing cause for a hearing with Armstrong detailed \u201cdaily violent threats\u201d by the YouTuber in addition to responses to emails with threats and insults before being served with process papers. The legal team also reported in a March 20 filing that one of Armstrong\u2019s voicemails included the YouTuber allegedly threatening to surround Moskowitz\u2019s home with protesters \u201c24/7 day and night.\u201d \u201cThe scope of the attacks (including death threats), which examples are provided in those filings and which continue on a daily basis since, necessitated Undersigned Counsel to open an FBI investigation into Armstrong, as well as the investigation files by local police authorities for Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and their families,\u201d said Moskowitz. Twitter posts from Armstrong claimed the original lawsuit regarding disclosure of compensation from FTX had \u201cabsolutely no merit.\u201d The crypto influencer is no stranger to online controversy, regularly insulting high-profile figures, including European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde and being generally dismissive of the class-action lawsuit. So let me get this straight\u2026 Adam Moskowitz frivolously attaches me falsely as a paid promoter of FTX, a site where people lot EVERYTHING\u2026 many lost life savings. Many on brink of suicide. And this fragile pussy claims he is the one scared and at risk because I call him names. Related: YouTube appoints Web3-friendly exec as new CEO In August 2022, Armstrong filed a defamation suit against YouTuber Erling Mengshoel Jr. \u2014 also known as Atozy \u2014 in response to a video Mengshoel posted claiming that \u201cThis YouTuber scams his fans\u2026 Bitboy Crypto.\u201d Armstrong dropped the lawsuit after Mengshoel raised more than $200,000 in a campaign for his defense in less than 24 hours.

                  "content": "God save our gracious coin, and long live the coin. A team of entrepreneurs, environmentalists and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have assembled to back Bitcoin in Britain. Bitcoin Policy UK (BPUK) unites stakeholders, policymakers, environmentalists, tax specialists, Bitcoin experts and miners to \u201cunlock the potential of Bitcoin\u201d in Britain and explore how the decentralized currency\u2019s burgeoning industry could benefit U.K. households, businesses and communities. BPUK\u2019s primary objectives are to drive investment, generate and prepare students for the Bitcoin jobs of the future, raise awareness and education, and explore the use of wasted and stranded energy resources for Bitcoin mining. Freddie New, BPUK\u2019s head of policy, told Cointelegraph that \u201cthe genesis of this project was the Bitcoin Collective Conference in Edinburgh\u201d \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s largest Bitcoin conference, taking place in fall 2022 . New told Cointelegraph that most of the team had been working on Bitcoin advocacy in one way or another before the conference, \u201cbut coming together like this will enable us to formalize these efforts and focus on three key related areas.\u201d He continued: Some of the advisers and board members are familiar to Cointelegraph readers. Author and journalist DecentraSuze, whose son recently introduced Bitcoin to the classroom , is a director, while Jordan Walker, co-founder of The Bitcoin Collective , and Mark Morton are advisers. Morton\u2019s Bitcoin mining company, Scilling Digital Mining, was featured in a recent Cointelegraph mini-documentary: Walker told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is an important piece of the collective puzzle to drive Bitcoin education in the U.K.: New told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is not-for-profit. To operate, it hopes to raise funds through the community, tapping into the growing trend of funding projects with satoshis , or small amounts of BTC, via the Lightning Network, a layer-2 instant payment solution built atop Bitcoin. Part of the team\u2019s mission is to locate and harness renewable, wasted or stranded energy across the U.K., New explained. He continued with the plan: \u201cWe can then invite British policymakers to these sites so they can see mines in action and hopefully understand more about the industry\u2019s potential to mitigate vented methane, provide demand response for renewable grids, or simply act as a customer for energy that is otherwise wasted.\u201d The U.K. has burgeoning renewable energy sources but lacks in hash rate (a measure of the Bitcoin protocol\u2019s security). According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the U.K. supports 0.23% of the global monthly hash rate, compared with the United States\u2019 37.84%. This is partly due to electricity costs in the U.K. exceeding those of the U.S. and Asia, but also due to Bitcoin mining awareness \u2014 or a lack thereof \u2014 in the U.K. Moreover, legacy media platforms have taken aim at the Bitcoin mining industry in recent years \u2014 the Guardian critiqued Bitcoin as \u201cdigital beef\u201d instead of \u201cdigital gold.\u201d BPUK highlighted that in light of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union, it could develop a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency regime separate from that of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in Europe. The European parliamentary committee on MiCA may threaten Bitcoin mining on the continent . BPUK co-founder Krista Edmunds took inspiration from El Salvador\u2019s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Edmunds explained: On the governmental side, the policy group will have an opportunity to educate and inform. Lisa Cameron, a member of Parliament and chairperson of the Crypto and Digital Assets All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), told Cointelegraph in an interview last year: \u201cWe are on a learning curve, and it\u2019s just very, very important because the U.K. government has a policy vision that the U.K. will become an international hub of cryptocurrency and digital assets.\u201d She added that there was some confusion surrounding Bitcoin, central bank digital currencies and cryptocurrency. New explained that as a Bitcoin-only organization, the BPUK ultimately seeks to \u201cmake sure that Bitcoin is included in the government\u2019s proposals, if not at the front and center.\"",

Cynthia Del Pozo Garcia, Gemini's director of strategy and corporate development, wrote: According to Del Pozo Garcia, Gemini holds holds \"many licenses globally,\" such as state money transmitter licenses, an E-Money License from the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom, and an E-Money License from the Central Bank of Ireland. \"Related to our licenses, Gemini must undergo annual audits of our financial statements and is subject to bank examinations conducted by the New York Department of Financial Services,\" the director said. On Feb. 22, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) published a notice requiring all crypto asset trading platforms to sign a legally binding pre-registration undertaking to continue operating in the country. Among many restrictions, exchanges will be prohibited from allowing Canadian clients to buy or deposit stablecoins without prior approval from the CSA. Since the new regulations took effect, cryptocurrency exchange OKX has announced it would cease operations in Canada by June 2023. Meanwhile, fintech company Paxos said it would withdraw from Canada , citing regulatory uncertainty.

                  "description": "BTC price continues to show strength and derivatives data suggests that bulls intend to press Bitcoin higher.",
                  "content": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) price maintained the $30,000 support as lower-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released on April 12. The official inflation rate for March increased 5% year on year, which was slightly less than the 5.1% consensus. It was the lowest reading since May 2021, but is still significantly higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The data suggests that inflation is no longer the driving force behind Bitcoin\u2019s rally and Investors' focus shifted from the impact of inflationary pressure to potential recession risks after the banking crisis revealed how fragile the financial system was following the Federal Reserve's twelve-month hike in interest rates from 0.10% to 4.85%. Aside from the Silicon Valley Bank bankruptcy and the government-backed sale of Credit Suisse to UBS, several warning signs of a macroeconomic downturn have emerged. The most recent ISM Purchasing Managers Index data fell to its lowest level since May 2020, indicating an economic contraction. According to Federal Reserve documents released on April 12, the aftermath of the U.S. banking crisis is likely to push the economy into a \"mild recession\" later this year. Because of the crisis, some have speculated that the Fed will hold off on raising interest rates, but officials affirmed that more effort is needed to keep inflation under control. According to a Moody's Analytics report, commercial real estate prices fell 1.6% in February, the most since the 2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, the national office vacancy rate reached 16.5%, indicating the severity of the economic difficulties that businesses are currently facing. Whatever the reason for Bitcoin's 50% rally between March 11 and April 11, it demonstrates resilience to FUD, including the SEC's Wells Notice against Coinbase on March 22, and the CFTC filing a suit against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao on March 27. By holding the $30,000 support, Bitcoin demonstrates that the positive momentum can continue regardless of whether inflation remains above 5%. Not everyone is cheering the rally, particularly traders who have placed bearish bets using Bitcoin options. The April 14 open interest for BTC options expiry is $950 million, with $490 million in call (buy) options and $460 million in put (sell) options. Bears have been caught off guard, with less than 7% of their bets exceeding $29,000. Below are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of call (buy) and put (sell) options contracts available on April 14 varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit: This rough estimate considers only call options in bullish bets and put options in neutral-to-bearish trades. Nonetheless, this oversimplification excludes more complex investment strategies. A trader, for example, could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a certain price, but this effect is difficult to estimate. Related: Bitcoin-friendly PPI data boosts bulls as Ether price fights for $2K Bulls are expected to push Bitcoin above $30,500 on April 14 at 8:00 a.m UTC to profit an additional $100 million. Bears, on the other hand, would need to pressure Bitcoin's price below $29,000 in order to balance the scales. However, bears have recently suffered significant losses as BTC futures short contracts were forcibly liquidated to the tune of $128 million between April 9 and April 11. As the most likely scenario favors Bitcoin bulls, their profits will most likely be used to reinforce the $30,000 support. Bears might consider licking their wounds and waiting for additional actions from regulators as the macroeconomic scenario is currently bullish for supply capped assets.

                  "description": "You might think that new tax reporting rules for exchanges should mean less work for the taxpayer, but it\u2019s the opposite, says CPA Kirk Phillips.",
                  "content": "Kirk Phillips Kirk Phillips is a CPA, entrepreneur and founder of Global Crypto Advisors and Crypto Blocko, a business, accounting and tax resource site. This article is part of CoinDesk\u2019s Tax Week series. The U.S. Infrastructure and Jobs Act ushered in \u201cbroker reporting\u201d rules for centralized crypto exchanges, effectively turning digital assets into securities for purposes of the Section 6045 reporting requirement. Stock trading firms issue tax forms 1099-Bs with sales of securities and capital gains and losses, so centralized exchanges will do the same thing for crypto trades on the new Form 1099-DA. Cash App and Robinhood Crypto, for example, have already been issuing crypto trades on 1099-Bs for several years. This article is part of CoinDesk's Tax Guide 2023 . Kirk Phillips is an entrepreneur, Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and author of \"The Ultimate Bitcoin Business Guide: For Entrepreneurs & Business Advisors.\" At first glance it might seem like crypto reporting by exchanges means less work for the taxpayer, but it\u2019s the opposite. This creates a huge burden for centralized exchanges and saddles the taxpayer with a more onerous crypto tax reporting exercise. Taxpayers in other regimes that implement similar rules will suffer the same fate. Let\u2019s dig deeper and find out why. The U.S. has a voluntary tax compliance system where the taxpayer is responsible for calculating and filing their own taxes. Taxpayers report two kinds of information: The Internal Revenue Service matches amounts reported by third parties to make sure they\u2019re the same amounts reported by the taxpayer. Third-party tax forms include W-2s, 1099s, 1098s and so on. Taxpayers self-report any income, expenses or deductions not reported on third-party forms. Both of those reporting methods were completely separate until now. Crypto tax calculations were mostly the 100% self-reported variety, but the new broker reporting rules relegate taxpayers to a combination of third-party and self-reporting, and that\u2019s where the problem begins. Taxpayers will still manage their entire view of crypto tax calculations. Meanwhile, multiple exchanges will report their tiny view of a taxpayer\u2019s crypto landscape, leaving the taxpayer to piece together 1099-DAs and figure out whether they\u2019re correct. What\u2019s been described in these pages as \u201c The Maddening Task of Calculating Crypto Taxes \u201d is the first clue the new reporting rules will create more crypto tax headaches, not less. Taxpayers can easily rack up five to 10 times more wallets and exchange accounts than stock trading and bank accounts while having to untangle a web of crypto transactions contained within. Most crypto tax software providers deployed the universal cost basis feature that dumps all transactions into a single bucket for calculation purposes. Alice (not her real name!) has been in crypto for six years and accumulated seven exchange accounts and 13 wallets. The software commingles all her transactions from 2018 up to the current year and makes one calculation as if Alice was only using one wallet. Under the new rules, Alice would receive seven 1099-DAs in addition to her own universal calculation. Alice is no longer solely responsible for her crypto tax calculations and instead has eight parties, including herself, in on the calculation exercise. Alice has been calculating and self-reporting her crypto taxes on Form 8949 for years. She disregards the seven 1099-DAs because she\u2019s already included all her transactions in the current Form 8949. Alice files her tax return as usual and gets flustered after receiving an IRS notice saying she underreported income. Now Alice must amend her tax return and report the information as received on the 1099-DAs. Bob, on the other hand, has eight wallets and four exchange accounts. He reported four 1099-DAs on his tax return and deleted the transactions for those four exchanges from his crypto tax software. Bob thought this was a clever solution to avoid double-counting his exchange transactions, but he didn\u2019t realize two of the exchanges didn\u2019t report cost basis on 1099-DAs. As a result, he overstated his capital gains and significantly overpaid more tax than he should have. Bob and Alice have run headfirst into some of the numerous 1099-DA pitfalls. Now they must go through a rigorous exercise to reconcile all the 1099-DAs with their own universal calculation to double-check the exchanges correctly reported information. The challenge of managing crypto taxes just got magnified. In the absence of a thorough reconciliation and cross-checking exercise, taxpayers will otherwise double count and/or omit cost basis and therefore understate or overstate tax liabilities. Let\u2019s look at some other 1099-DA pitfalls. U.S. taxpayers can use FIFO, first in first out, or specific identification for crypto cost-basis methods just like securities sales. FIFO is simply a tracking method where the oldest crypto purchased is considered the first crypto sold and specific identification allows taxpayers to choose a specific batch of crypto to sell before selling it. In legacy finance, a taxpayer can give notice to their securities broker to use specific identification and then instruct the broker which tax lot of securities to sell. Specific identification doesn\u2019t work this way in crypto because both exchanges and crypto tax software don\u2019t provide any pre-sale identifying mechanisms. This means exchanges will default to providing FIFO-only cost basis on 1099-DAs. Meanwhile, taxpayers use several cost method methods, numerous other ways crypto is considered sold for tax purposes, as proxies for specific identification because the cost basis in the calculation is \u201cidentified\u201d after the sale instead of before. Nonetheless, if exchanges report on a FIFO basis and the taxpayer uses specific identification, then reconciling between the two will be impossible. This illustrates how cost basis would be double counted and/or omitted because the taxpayers and exchanges are using inconsistent cost basis methods. Cost-basis tracking on a per-wallet and exchange basis would help the reconciliation process but doesn\u2019t come without its own issues. Several crypto tax software providers, such as Cointracker and Bitwave, are rolling out per-wallet and exchange tracking and some already had these features. Alice has consistently used the FIFO cost basis method and wants to reconcile her 1099-DAs so she switches her crypto software from universal to per-wallet tracking. She\u2019s surprised to get different gains and losses for each tax year, but her new CPA explains the calculations go back to 2018 and the per-wallet method is recalculating what has already been calculated in prior years. Crypto software must lock down cost basis at the end of 2022, for example, so the shift to per wallet tracking avoids the double-counting and/or omissions dilemma. It\u2019s unclear how exchanges are going to manage customer basis and data tracking because 1099-DA reporting is currently deferred until final regulations are issued. One thing is clear, though \u2013 there will be differences and taxpayers will have extra work to correctly adjust gains and losses on their tax returns. Form 8949, used to report the detail all crypto trades, has adjustment codes to deal with incorrectly reported basis and other issues. However, this is easier said than done. In addition to the normal crypto tax headaches, taxpayers must track 1099-DA reconciliation differences, calculate adjustments and figure out reporting so final gains and losses are correct. There are also many other issues too numerous to mention here. Bob, a decentralized finance (DeFi) degen, wants to avoid the 1099-DA conundrums and decided to use his centralized exchanges as stablecoin-only on- and off-ramps and use DeFi protocols for all his other crypto activity. His 1099-DAs would only show stablecoin sales with gains and losses essentially zero, thus eliminating the reconciliation and adjustment exercise. Bob is going to minimize transfers among exchanges to keep activity as self-contained as possible. He\u2019s also considering opening new exchange accounts to containerize new trades and cost basis when 1099-DAs are finally issued. We need crypto tax management to get easier, not harder. The ideal compromise for final broker reporting rules would be removing the cost basis reporting requirement to eliminate most of the cost basis reconciliation headaches. Then taxpayers would only have to deal with reconciling reported proceeds from trades. Fortunately, the delay with 1099-DA will give more time for exchanges to develop better reporting, crypto tax software providers to develop more useful tracking features and taxpayers to strategize ways to minimize headaches.

                  "content": "A federal magistrate judge has signed an order requiring BitBoy Crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong to appear in Florida as part of a status conference related to a lawsuit involving several crypto influencers. In an April 12 filing in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Judge Melissa Damian ordered Armstrong and his counsel to appear on April 20 along with the legal team representing the influencers. According to the order, the conference was aimed at bringing awareness of \u201cArmstrong\u2019s harassment towards plaintiffs\u2019 counsel.\u201d Armstrong, along with several other YouTubers, were named in a $1-billion lawsuit filed on March 15 for allegedly promoting \u201cFTX crypto fraud without disclosing compensation.\u201d Adam Moskowitz, representing plaintiff Edwin Garrison and others in the class-action lawsuit, has claimed that Armstrong harassed the legal team with \u201cendless phone calls, tweets and emails,\u201d voicemails \u201cfull of vulgarities,\u201d and social media posts suggesting threats. An April 5 filing showing cause for a hearing with Armstrong detailed \u201cdaily violent threats\u201d by the YouTuber in addition to responses to emails with threats and insults before being served with process papers. The legal team also reported in a March 20 filing that one of Armstrong\u2019s voicemails included the YouTuber allegedly threatening to surround Moskowitz\u2019s home with protesters \u201c24/7 day and night.\u201d \u201cThe scope of the attacks (including death threats), which examples are provided in those filings and which continue on a daily basis since, necessitated Undersigned Counsel to open an FBI investigation into Armstrong, as well as the investigation files by local police authorities for Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and their families,\u201d said Moskowitz. Twitter posts from Armstrong claimed the original lawsuit regarding disclosure of compensation from FTX had \u201cabsolutely no merit.\u201d The crypto influencer is no stranger to online controversy, regularly insulting high-profile figures, including European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde and being generally dismissive of the class-action lawsuit. So let me get this straight\u2026 Adam Moskowitz frivolously attaches me falsely as a paid promoter of FTX, a site where people lot EVERYTHING\u2026 many lost life savings. Many on brink of suicide. And this fragile pussy claims he is the one scared and at risk because I call him names. Related: YouTube appoints Web3-friendly exec as new CEO In August 2022, Armstrong filed a defamation suit against YouTuber Erling Mengshoel Jr. \u2014 also known as Atozy \u2014 in response to a video Mengshoel posted claiming that \u201cThis YouTuber scams his fans\u2026 Bitboy Crypto.\u201d Armstrong dropped the lawsuit after Mengshoel raised more than $200,000 in a campaign for his defense in less than 24 hours.

                  "description": "A Bitcoin-only policy organization in the United Kingdom seeks to steer a course for greater levels of BTC adoption.",
                  "content": "God save our gracious coin, and long live the coin. A team of entrepreneurs, environmentalists and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have assembled to back Bitcoin in Britain. Bitcoin Policy UK (BPUK) unites stakeholders, policymakers, environmentalists, tax specialists, Bitcoin experts and miners to \u201cunlock the potential of Bitcoin\u201d in Britain and explore how the decentralized currency\u2019s burgeoning industry could benefit U.K. households, businesses and communities. BPUK\u2019s primary objectives are to drive investment, generate and prepare students for the Bitcoin jobs of the future, raise awareness and education, and explore the use of wasted and stranded energy resources for Bitcoin mining. Freddie New, BPUK\u2019s head of policy, told Cointelegraph that \u201cthe genesis of this project was the Bitcoin Collective Conference in Edinburgh\u201d \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s largest Bitcoin conference, taking place in fall 2022 . New told Cointelegraph that most of the team had been working on Bitcoin advocacy in one way or another before the conference, \u201cbut coming together like this will enable us to formalize these efforts and focus on three key related areas.\u201d He continued: Some of the advisers and board members are familiar to Cointelegraph readers. Author and journalist DecentraSuze, whose son recently introduced Bitcoin to the classroom , is a director, while Jordan Walker, co-founder of The Bitcoin Collective , and Mark Morton are advisers. Morton\u2019s Bitcoin mining company, Scilling Digital Mining, was featured in a recent Cointelegraph mini-documentary: Walker told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is an important piece of the collective puzzle to drive Bitcoin education in the U.K.: New told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is not-for-profit. To operate, it hopes to raise funds through the community, tapping into the growing trend of funding projects with satoshis , or small amounts of BTC, via the Lightning Network, a layer-2 instant payment solution built atop Bitcoin. Part of the team\u2019s mission is to locate and harness renewable, wasted or stranded energy across the U.K., New explained. He continued with the plan: \u201cWe can then invite British policymakers to these sites so they can see mines in action and hopefully understand more about the industry\u2019s potential to mitigate vented methane, provide demand response for renewable grids, or simply act as a customer for energy that is otherwise wasted.\u201d The U.K. has burgeoning renewable energy sources but lacks in hash rate (a measure of the Bitcoin protocol\u2019s security). According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the U.K. supports 0.23% of the global monthly hash rate, compared with the United States\u2019 37.84%. This is partly due to electricity costs in the U.K. exceeding those of the U.S. and Asia, but also due to Bitcoin mining awareness \u2014 or a lack thereof \u2014 in the U.K. Moreover, legacy media platforms have taken aim at the Bitcoin mining industry in recent years \u2014 the Guardian critiqued Bitcoin as \u201cdigital beef\u201d instead of \u201cdigital gold.\u201d BPUK highlighted that in light of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union, it could develop a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency regime separate from that of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in Europe. The European parliamentary committee on MiCA may threaten Bitcoin mining on the continent . BPUK co-founder Krista Edmunds took inspiration from El Salvador\u2019s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Edmunds explained: On the governmental side, the policy group will have an opportunity to educate and inform. Lisa Cameron, a member of Parliament and chairperson of the Crypto and Digital Assets All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), told Cointelegraph in an interview last year: \u201cWe are on a learning curve, and it\u2019s just very, very important because the U.K. government has a policy vision that the U.K. will become an international hub of cryptocurrency and digital assets.\u201d She added that there was some confusion surrounding Bitcoin, central bank digital currencies and cryptocurrency. New explained that as a Bitcoin-only organization, the BPUK ultimately seeks to \u201cmake sure that Bitcoin is included in the government\u2019s proposals, if not at the front and center.\"",

                  "content": "By Elijah Asdourian, James Lee, Nasiha Salwati, Louise SheinerWhat\u2019s the latest thinking in fiscal and monetary policy? The Hutchins Roundup keeps you informed of the latest research, charts, and speeches. Want to receive the Hutchins Roundup as an email? Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday. Men, but not women, leave school when short-term earnings opportunities arise J\u00f3sef Sigurdsson of Stockholm University finds that a change to the Icelandic tax code led men to drop out of school without similarly affecting women. Iceland collected no income tax on earnings in 1987 as it changed its national taxation system, creating an opportunity for Icelanders to earn substantially more in the short term. Dropout rates for men who were just old enough to leave high school and start working were 5 percentage points higher than for men just below the cutoff, while dropout rates for women were unchanged. Dropouts rarely returned to school and suffered large losses in lifetime income despite higher earnings in the years after 1987. The findings indicate that short-term earnings opportunities affect men and women differently, suggesting \u201cgender differences in nonpecuniary costs of school attendance, myopia, or perceived returns to education.\u201d The tradeoff between inflation and labor market slack is higher in tight labor markets Using U.S. industry-level data over the 1959 to 2022 period, Simon C. Smith of the Federal Reserve Board, Allan Timmermann of the University of California, San Diego, and Jonathan H. Wright of Johns Hopkins University find that the Phillips Curve \u2013 the relationship between inflation and labor market slack \u2013 steepened in 1972 (meaning that inflation became more sensitive to slack) and flattened in 2001. The flattening was more pronounced for goods prices than service prices and concentrated in metropolitan areas with higher rates of import penetration from China. The authors also find that the Phillips Curve is nonlinear and steeper when the labor market is tight. A steeper Phillips Curve and a higher natural rate of unemployment can explain about half of the surge in prices over the 2020-2022 period, they find. Breaks in the slope of the Phillips Curve make pre-break data less informative for policymakers, causing them to be less certain about the relationship between the unemployment gap and inflation. To compensate for this additional caution, policymakers \u201crespond less aggressively to deviations in the unemployment gap but, conversely, respond more aggressively to deviations from target inflation,\u201d the authors say. China\u2019s growing role in cross-border rescue lending China\u2019s role as an international lender of last resort has grown exponentially in recent years, according to Sebastian Horn of the World Bank and co-authors. Since 2000, more than 20 debtor countries \u2014 primarily debtors of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative \u2014 have received $240 billion USD from the People\u2019s Bank of China in rescue lending \u2014 $170 billion USD via a global swap line that is quickly growing, and $70 billion USD in rescue loans for balance of payments support. Of this, $185 billion USD was lent between 2016 and 2021. China\u2019s overseas lending, the authors say, is making the international financial system more multipolar, less institutionalized, and less transparent. Chart of the week: Core services inflation remains high Chart courtesy of Jason Furman Quote of the week: \u201cWith financial instability contained, monetary policy should remain focused on bringing inflation down, but stand ready to quickly adjust to financial developments. A silver lining is that the banking turmoil will help slow aggregate activity as banks curtail lending. In and of itself, this should partially mitigate the need for further monetary tightening to achieve the same policy stance. But any expectation that central banks will prematurely surrender the inflation fight would have the opposite effect: lowering yields, supporting activity beyond what is warranted, and ultimately complicating the task of monetary authorities. Fiscal policy can also play an active role. By cooling off economic activity, tighter fiscal policy would support monetary policy, allowing real interest rates to return faster to a low natural level. Appropriately designed fiscal consolidation will also help rebuild much needed buffers and help strengthen financial stability. While fiscal policy is turning less expansionary in many countries this year, more could be done to regain fiscal space,\u201d says Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Economic Counsellor of the International Monetary Fund. \u201cOur latest projections also indicate an overall slowdown in medium-term growth forecasts. Five-year ahead growth projections declined steadily from 4.6% in 2011 to 3% in 2023. Some of this decline reflects the growth slowdown of previously rapidly growing economies such as China or Korea. This is predictable: growth slows down as countries converge. But some of the more recent slowdown may also reflect more ominous forces: the scarring impact of the pandemic, a slower pace of structural reforms, as well as the rising and increasingly real threat of geoeconomic fragmentation leading to more trade tensions, less direct investment, and a slower pace of innovation and technology adoption across fragmented \u2018blocks.\u2019 A fragmented world is unlikely to achieve progress for all, or to successfully tackle global challenges such as climate change or pandemic preparedness. We must avoid that path at all costs.\u201d The Brookings Institution is financed through the support of a diverse array of foundations, corporations, governments, individuals, as well as an endowment.

                  "content": "On April 12, cryptocurrency exchange Gemini announced it filed a pre-registration undertaking with the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), which oversees capital markets in Canada's most populous province. The undertaking is a prerequisite to becoming a restricted dealer in Canada and is necessary for all cryptocurrency exchanges wishing to conduct business in the country. Cynthia Del Pozo Garcia, Gemini's director of strategy and corporate development, wrote: According to Del Pozo Garcia, Gemini holds holds \"many licenses globally,\" such as state money transmitter licenses, an E-Money License from the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom, and an E-Money License from the Central Bank of Ireland. \"Related to our licenses, Gemini must undergo annual audits of our financial statements and is subject to bank examinations conducted by the New York Department of Financial Services,\" the director said. On Feb. 22, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) published a notice requiring all crypto asset trading platforms to sign a legally binding pre-registration undertaking to continue operating in the country. Among many restrictions, exchanges will be prohibited from allowing Canadian clients to buy or deposit stablecoins without prior approval from the CSA. Since the new regulations took effect, cryptocurrency exchange OKX has announced it would cease operations in Canada by June 2023. Meanwhile, fintech company Paxos said it would withdraw from Canada , citing regulatory uncertainty. Binance and Kraken have since stated that they filed the pre-registration undertaking required to continue operations in the country. Related: OKX to cease operations in Canada by June 22, 2023",

                  "description": "BTC price continues to show strength and derivatives data suggests that bulls intend to press Bitcoin higher.",
                  "content": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) price maintained the $30,000 support as lower-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released on April 12. The official inflation rate for March increased 5% year on year, which was slightly less than the 5.1% consensus. It was the lowest reading since May 2021, but is still significantly higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The data suggests that inflation is no longer the driving force behind Bitcoin\u2019s rally and Investors' focus shifted from the impact of inflationary pressure to potential recession risks after the banking crisis revealed how fragile the financial system was following the Federal Reserve's twelve-month hike in interest rates from 0.10% to 4.85%. Aside from the Silicon Valley Bank bankruptcy and the government-backed sale of Credit Suisse to UBS, several warning signs of a macroeconomic downturn have emerged. The most recent ISM Purchasing Managers Index data fell to its lowest level since May 2020, indicating an economic contraction. According to Federal Reserve documents released on April 12, the aftermath of the U.S. banking crisis is likely to push the economy into a \"mild recession\" later this year. Because of the crisis, some have speculated that the Fed will hold off on raising interest rates, but officials affirmed that more effort is needed to keep inflation under control. According to a Moody's Analytics report, commercial real estate prices fell 1.6% in February, the most since the 2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, the national office vacancy rate reached 16.5%, indicating the severity of the economic difficulties that businesses are currently facing. Whatever the reason for Bitcoin's 50% rally between March 11 and April 11, it demonstrates resilience to FUD, including the SEC's Wells Notice against Coinbase on March 22, and the CFTC filing a suit against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao on March 27. By holding the $30,000 support, Bitcoin demonstrates that the positive momentum can continue regardless of whether inflation remains above 5%. Not everyone is cheering the rally, particularly traders who have placed bearish bets using Bitcoin options. The April 14 open interest for BTC options expiry is $950 million, with $490 million in call (buy) options and $460 million in put (sell) options. Bears have been caught off guard, with less than 7% of their bets exceeding $29,000. Below are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of call (buy) and put (sell) options contracts available on April 14 varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit: This rough estimate considers only call options in bullish bets and put options in neutral-to-bearish trades. Nonetheless, this oversimplification excludes more complex investment strategies. A trader, for example, could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a certain price, but this effect is difficult to estimate. Related: Bitcoin-friendly PPI data boosts bulls as Ether price fights for $2K Bulls are expected to push Bitcoin above $30,500 on April 14 at 8:00 a.m UTC to profit an additional $100 million. Bears, on the other hand, would need to pressure Bitcoin's price below $29,000 in order to balance the scales. However, bears have recently suffered significant losses as BTC futures short contracts were forcibly liquidated to the tune of $128 million between April 9 and April 11. As the most likely scenario favors Bitcoin bulls, their profits will most likely be used to reinforce the $30,000 support. Bears might consider licking their wounds and waiting for additional actions from regulators as the macroeconomic scenario is currently bullish for supply capped assets.

                  "description": "You might think that new tax reporting rules for exchanges should mean less work for the taxpayer, but it\u2019s the opposite, says CPA Kirk Phillips.",
                  "content": "Kirk Phillips Kirk Phillips is a CPA, entrepreneur and founder of Global Crypto Advisors and Crypto Blocko, a business, accounting and tax resource site. This article is part of CoinDesk\u2019s Tax Week series. The U.S. Infrastructure and Jobs Act ushered in \u201cbroker reporting\u201d rules for centralized crypto exchanges, effectively turning digital assets into securities for purposes of the Section 6045 reporting requirement. Stock trading firms issue tax forms 1099-Bs with sales of securities and capital gains and losses, so centralized exchanges will do the same thing for crypto trades on the new Form 1099-DA. Cash App and Robinhood Crypto, for example, have already been issuing crypto trades on 1099-Bs for several years. This article is part of CoinDesk's Tax Guide 2023 . Kirk Phillips is an entrepreneur, Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and author of \"The Ultimate Bitcoin Business Guide: For Entrepreneurs & Business Advisors.\" At first glance it might seem like crypto reporting by exchanges means less work for the taxpayer, but it\u2019s the opposite. This creates a huge burden for centralized exchanges and saddles the taxpayer with a more onerous crypto tax reporting exercise. Taxpayers in other regimes that implement similar rules will suffer the same fate. Let\u2019s dig deeper and find out why. The U.S. has a voluntary tax compliance system where the taxpayer is responsible for calculating and filing their own taxes. Taxpayers report two kinds of information: The Internal Revenue Service matches amounts reported by third parties to make sure they\u2019re the same amounts reported by the taxpayer. Third-party tax forms include W-2s, 1099s, 1098s and so on. Taxpayers self-report any income, expenses or deductions not reported on third-party forms. Both of those reporting methods were completely separate until now. Crypto tax calculations were mostly the 100% self-reported variety, but the new broker reporting rules relegate taxpayers to a combination of third-party and self-reporting, and that\u2019s where the problem begins. Taxpayers will still manage their entire view of crypto tax calculations. Meanwhile, multiple exchanges will report their tiny view of a taxpayer\u2019s crypto landscape, leaving the taxpayer to piece together 1099-DAs and figure out whether they\u2019re correct. What\u2019s been described in these pages as \u201c The Maddening Task of Calculating Crypto Taxes \u201d is the first clue the new reporting rules will create more crypto tax headaches, not less. Taxpayers can easily rack up five to 10 times more wallets and exchange accounts than stock trading and bank accounts while having to untangle a web of crypto transactions contained within. Most crypto tax software providers deployed the universal cost basis feature that dumps all transactions into a single bucket for calculation purposes. Alice (not her real name!) has been in crypto for six years and accumulated seven exchange accounts and 13 wallets. The software commingles all her transactions from 2018 up to the current year and makes one calculation as if Alice was only using one wallet. Under the new rules, Alice would receive seven 1099-DAs in addition to her own universal calculation. Alice is no longer solely responsible for her crypto tax calculations and instead has eight parties, including herself, in on the calculation exercise. Alice has been calculating and self-reporting her crypto taxes on Form 8949 for years. She disregards the seven 1099-DAs because she\u2019s already included all her transactions in the current Form 8949. Alice files her tax return as usual and gets flustered after receiving an IRS notice saying she underreported income. Now Alice must amend her tax return and report the information as received on the 1099-DAs. Bob, on the other hand, has eight wallets and four exchange accounts. He reported four 1099-DAs on his tax return and deleted the transactions for those four exchanges from his crypto tax software. Bob thought this was a clever solution to avoid double-counting his exchange transactions, but he didn\u2019t realize two of the exchanges didn\u2019t report cost basis on 1099-DAs. As a result, he overstated his capital gains and significantly overpaid more tax than he should have. Bob and Alice have run headfirst into some of the numerous 1099-DA pitfalls. Now they must go through a rigorous exercise to reconcile all the 1099-DAs with their own universal calculation to double-check the exchanges correctly reported information. The challenge of managing crypto taxes just got magnified. In the absence of a thorough reconciliation and cross-checking exercise, taxpayers will otherwise double count and/or omit cost basis and therefore understate or overstate tax liabilities. Let\u2019s look at some other 1099-DA pitfalls. U.S. taxpayers can use FIFO, first in first out, or specific identification for crypto cost-basis methods just like securities sales. FIFO is simply a tracking method where the oldest crypto purchased is considered the first crypto sold and specific identification allows taxpayers to choose a specific batch of crypto to sell before selling it. In legacy finance, a taxpayer can give notice to their securities broker to use specific identification and then instruct the broker which tax lot of securities to sell. Specific identification doesn\u2019t work this way in crypto because both exchanges and crypto tax software don\u2019t provide any pre-sale identifying mechanisms. This means exchanges will default to providing FIFO-only cost basis on 1099-DAs. Meanwhile, taxpayers use several cost method methods, numerous other ways crypto is considered sold for tax purposes, as proxies for specific identification because the cost basis in the calculation is \u201cidentified\u201d after the sale instead of before. Nonetheless, if exchanges report on a FIFO basis and the taxpayer uses specific identification, then reconciling between the two will be impossible. This illustrates how cost basis would be double counted and/or omitted because the taxpayers and exchanges are using inconsistent cost basis methods. Cost-basis tracking on a per-wallet and exchange basis would help the reconciliation process but doesn\u2019t come without its own issues. Several crypto tax software providers, such as Cointracker and Bitwave, are rolling out per-wallet and exchange tracking and some already had these features. Alice has consistently used the FIFO cost basis method and wants to reconcile her 1099-DAs so she switches her crypto software from universal to per-wallet tracking. She\u2019s surprised to get different gains and losses for each tax year, but her new CPA explains the calculations go back to 2018 and the per-wallet method is recalculating what has already been calculated in prior years. Crypto software must lock down cost basis at the end of 2022, for example, so the shift to per wallet tracking avoids the double-counting and/or omissions dilemma. It\u2019s unclear how exchanges are going to manage customer basis and data tracking because 1099-DA reporting is currently deferred until final regulations are issued. One thing is clear, though \u2013 there will be differences and taxpayers will have extra work to correctly adjust gains and losses on their tax returns. Form 8949, used to report the detail all crypto trades, has adjustment codes to deal with incorrectly reported basis and other issues. However, this is easier said than done. In addition to the normal crypto tax headaches, taxpayers must track 1099-DA reconciliation differences, calculate adjustments and figure out reporting so final gains and losses are correct. There are also many other issues too numerous to mention here. Bob, a decentralized finance (DeFi) degen, wants to avoid the 1099-DA conundrums and decided to use his centralized exchanges as stablecoin-only on- and off-ramps and use DeFi protocols for all his other crypto activity. His 1099-DAs would only show stablecoin sales with gains and losses essentially zero, thus eliminating the reconciliation and adjustment exercise. Bob is going to minimize transfers among exchanges to keep activity as self-contained as possible. He\u2019s also considering opening new exchange accounts to containerize new trades and cost basis when 1099-DAs are finally issued. We need crypto tax management to get easier, not harder. The ideal compromise for final broker reporting rules would be removing the cost basis reporting requirement to eliminate most of the cost basis reconciliation headaches. Then taxpayers would only have to deal with reconciling reported proceeds from trades. Fortunately, the delay with 1099-DA will give more time for exchanges to develop better reporting, crypto tax software providers to develop more useful tracking features and taxpayers to strategize ways to minimize headaches.

According to the order, the conference was aimed at bringing awareness of \u201cArmstrong\u2019s harassment towards plaintiffs\u2019 counsel.\u201d Armstrong, along with several other YouTubers, were named in a $1-billion lawsuit filed on March 15 for allegedly promoting \u201cFTX crypto fraud without disclosing compensation.\u201d Adam Moskowitz, representing plaintiff Edwin Garrison and others in the class-action lawsuit, has claimed that Armstrong harassed the legal team with \u201cendless phone calls, tweets and emails,\u201d voicemails \u201cfull of vulgarities,\u201d and social media posts suggesting threats. An April 5 filing showing cause for a hearing with Armstrong detailed \u201cdaily violent threats\u201d by the YouTuber in addition to responses to emails with threats and insults before being served with process papers. The legal team also reported in a March 20 filing that one of Armstrong\u2019s voicemails included the YouTuber allegedly threatening to surround Moskowitz\u2019s home with protesters \u201c24/7 day and night.\u201d \u201cThe scope of the attacks (including death threats), which examples are provided in those filings and which continue on a daily basis since, necessitated Undersigned Counsel to open an FBI investigation into Armstrong, as well as the investigation files by local police authorities for Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and their families,\u201d said Moskowitz. Twitter posts from Armstrong claimed the original lawsuit regarding disclosure of compensation from FTX had \u201cabsolutely no merit.\u201d The crypto influencer is no stranger to online controversy, regularly insulting high-profile figures, including European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde and being generally dismissive of the class-action lawsuit. So let me get this straight\u2026 Adam Moskowitz frivolously attaches me falsely as a paid promoter of FTX, a site where people lot EVERYTHING\u2026 many lost life savings. Many on brink of suicide. And this fragile pussy claims he is the one scared and at risk because I call him names. Related: YouTube appoints Web3-friendly exec as new CEO In August 2022, Armstrong filed a defamation suit against YouTuber Erling Mengshoel Jr. \u2014 also known as Atozy \u2014 in response to a video Mengshoel posted claiming that \u201cThis YouTuber scams his fans\u2026 Bitboy Crypto.\u201d Armstrong dropped the lawsuit after Mengshoel raised more than $200,000 in a campaign for his defense in less than 24 hours.

                  "content": "God save our gracious coin, and long live the coin. A team of entrepreneurs, environmentalists and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have assembled to back Bitcoin in Britain. Bitcoin Policy UK (BPUK) unites stakeholders, policymakers, environmentalists, tax specialists, Bitcoin experts and miners to \u201cunlock the potential of Bitcoin\u201d in Britain and explore how the decentralized currency\u2019s burgeoning industry could benefit U.K. households, businesses and communities. BPUK\u2019s primary objectives are to drive investment, generate and prepare students for the Bitcoin jobs of the future, raise awareness and education, and explore the use of wasted and stranded energy resources for Bitcoin mining. Freddie New, BPUK\u2019s head of policy, told Cointelegraph that \u201cthe genesis of this project was the Bitcoin Collective Conference in Edinburgh\u201d \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s largest Bitcoin conference, taking place in fall 2022 . New told Cointelegraph that most of the team had been working on Bitcoin advocacy in one way or another before the conference, \u201cbut coming together like this will enable us to formalize these efforts and focus on three key related areas.\u201d He continued: Some of the advisers and board members are familiar to Cointelegraph readers. Author and journalist DecentraSuze, whose son recently introduced Bitcoin to the classroom , is a director, while Jordan Walker, co-founder of The Bitcoin Collective , and Mark Morton are advisers. Morton\u2019s Bitcoin mining company, Scilling Digital Mining, was featured in a recent Cointelegraph mini-documentary: Walker told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is an important piece of the collective puzzle to drive Bitcoin education in the U.K.: New told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is not-for-profit. To operate, it hopes to raise funds through the community, tapping into the growing trend of funding projects with satoshis , or small amounts of BTC, via the Lightning Network, a layer-2 instant payment solution built atop Bitcoin. Part of the team\u2019s mission is to locate and harness renewable, wasted or stranded energy across the U.K., New explained. He continued with the plan: \u201cWe can then invite British policymakers to these sites so they can see mines in action and hopefully understand more about the industry\u2019s potential to mitigate vented methane, provide demand response for renewable grids, or simply act as a customer for energy that is otherwise wasted.\u201d The U.K. has burgeoning renewable energy sources but lacks in hash rate (a measure of the Bitcoin protocol\u2019s security). According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the U.K. supports 0.23% of the global monthly hash rate, compared with the United States\u2019 37.84%. This is partly due to electricity costs in the U.K. exceeding those of the U.S. and Asia, but also due to Bitcoin mining awareness \u2014 or a lack thereof \u2014 in the U.K. Moreover, legacy media platforms have taken aim at the Bitcoin mining industry in recent years \u2014 the Guardian critiqued Bitcoin as \u201cdigital beef\u201d instead of \u201cdigital gold.\u201d BPUK highlighted that in light of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union, it could develop a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency regime separate from that of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in Europe. The European parliamentary committee on MiCA may threaten Bitcoin mining on the continent . BPUK co-founder Krista Edmunds took inspiration from El Salvador\u2019s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Edmunds explained: On the governmental side, the policy group will have an opportunity to educate and inform. Lisa Cameron, a member of Parliament and chairperson of the Crypto and Digital Assets All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), told Cointelegraph in an interview last year: \u201cWe are on a learning curve, and it\u2019s just very, very important because the U.K. government has a policy vision that the U.K. will become an international hub of cryptocurrency and digital assets.\u201d She added that there was some confusion surrounding Bitcoin, central bank digital currencies and cryptocurrency. New explained that as a Bitcoin-only organization, the BPUK ultimately seeks to \u201cmake sure that Bitcoin is included in the government\u2019s proposals, if not at the front and center.\"",

                  "content": "By Elijah Asdourian, James Lee, Nasiha Salwati, Louise SheinerWhat\u2019s the latest thinking in fiscal and monetary policy? The Hutchins Roundup keeps you informed of the latest research, charts, and speeches. Want to receive the Hutchins Roundup as an email? Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday. Men, but not women, leave school when short-term earnings opportunities arise J\u00f3sef Sigurdsson of Stockholm University finds that a change to the Icelandic tax code led men to drop out of school without similarly affecting women. Iceland collected no income tax on earnings in 1987 as it changed its national taxation system, creating an opportunity for Icelanders to earn substantially more in the short term. Dropout rates for men who were just old enough to leave high school and start working were 5 percentage points higher than for men just below the cutoff, while dropout rates for women were unchanged. Dropouts rarely returned to school and suffered large losses in lifetime income despite higher earnings in the years after 1987. The findings indicate that short-term earnings opportunities affect men and women differently, suggesting \u201cgender differences in nonpecuniary costs of school attendance, myopia, or perceived returns to education.\u201d The tradeoff between inflation and labor market slack is higher in tight labor markets Using U.S. industry-level data over the 1959 to 2022 period, Simon C. Smith of the Federal Reserve Board, Allan Timmermann of the University of California, San Diego, and Jonathan H. Wright of Johns Hopkins University find that the Phillips Curve \u2013 the relationship between inflation and labor market slack \u2013 steepened in 1972 (meaning that inflation became more sensitive to slack) and flattened in 2001. The flattening was more pronounced for goods prices than service prices and concentrated in metropolitan areas with higher rates of import penetration from China. The authors also find that the Phillips Curve is nonlinear and steeper when the labor market is tight. A steeper Phillips Curve and a higher natural rate of unemployment can explain about half of the surge in prices over the 2020-2022 period, they find. Breaks in the slope of the Phillips Curve make pre-break data less informative for policymakers, causing them to be less certain about the relationship between the unemployment gap and inflation. To compensate for this additional caution, policymakers \u201crespond less aggressively to deviations in the unemployment gap but, conversely, respond more aggressively to deviations from target inflation,\u201d the authors say. China\u2019s growing role in cross-border rescue lending China\u2019s role as an international lender of last resort has grown exponentially in recent years, according to Sebastian Horn of the World Bank and co-authors. Since 2000, more than 20 debtor countries \u2014 primarily debtors of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative \u2014 have received $240 billion USD from the People\u2019s Bank of China in rescue lending \u2014 $170 billion USD via a global swap line that is quickly growing, and $70 billion USD in rescue loans for balance of payments support. Of this, $185 billion USD was lent between 2016 and 2021. China\u2019s overseas lending, the authors say, is making the international financial system more multipolar, less institutionalized, and less transparent. Chart of the week: Core services inflation remains high Chart courtesy of Jason Furman Quote of the week: \u201cWith financial instability contained, monetary policy should remain focused on bringing inflation down, but stand ready to quickly adjust to financial developments. A silver lining is that the banking turmoil will help slow aggregate activity as banks curtail lending. In and of itself, this should partially mitigate the need for further monetary tightening to achieve the same policy stance. But any expectation that central banks will prematurely surrender the inflation fight would have the opposite effect: lowering yields, supporting activity beyond what is warranted, and ultimately complicating the task of monetary authorities. Fiscal policy can also play an active role. By cooling off economic activity, tighter fiscal policy would support monetary policy, allowing real interest rates to return faster to a low natural level. Appropriately designed fiscal consolidation will also help rebuild much needed buffers and help strengthen financial stability. While fiscal policy is turning less expansionary in many countries this year, more could be done to regain fiscal space,\u201d says Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Economic Counsellor of the International Monetary Fund. \u201cOur latest projections also indicate an overall slowdown in medium-term growth forecasts. Five-year ahead growth projections declined steadily from 4.6% in 2011 to 3% in 2023. Some of this decline reflects the growth slowdown of previously rapidly growing economies such as China or Korea. This is predictable: growth slows down as countries converge. But some of the more recent slowdown may also reflect more ominous forces: the scarring impact of the pandemic, a slower pace of structural reforms, as well as the rising and increasingly real threat of geoeconomic fragmentation leading to more trade tensions, less direct investment, and a slower pace of innovation and technology adoption across fragmented \u2018blocks.\u2019 A fragmented world is unlikely to achieve progress for all, or to successfully tackle global challenges such as climate change or pandemic preparedness. We must avoid that path at all costs.\u201d The Brookings Institution is financed through the support of a diverse array of foundations, corporations, governments, individuals, as well as an endowment.

Cynthia Del Pozo Garcia, Gemini's director of strategy and corporate development, wrote: According to Del Pozo Garcia, Gemini holds holds \"many licenses globally,\" such as state money transmitter licenses, an E-Money License from the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom, and an E-Money License from the Central Bank of Ireland. \"Related to our licenses, Gemini must undergo annual audits of our financial statements and is subject to bank examinations conducted by the New York Department of Financial Services,\" the director said. On Feb. 22, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) published a notice requiring all crypto asset trading platforms to sign a legally binding pre-registration undertaking to continue operating in the country. Among many restrictions, exchanges will be prohibited from allowing Canadian clients to buy or deposit stablecoins without prior approval from the CSA. Since the new regulations took effect, cryptocurrency exchange OKX has announced it would cease operations in Canada by June 2023. Meanwhile, fintech company Paxos said it would withdraw from Canada , citing regulatory uncertainty.

                  "description": "BTC price continues to show strength and derivatives data suggests that bulls intend to press Bitcoin higher.",
                  "content": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) price maintained the $30,000 support as lower-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released on April 12. The official inflation rate for March increased 5% year on year, which was slightly less than the 5.1% consensus. It was the lowest reading since May 2021, but is still significantly higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The data suggests that inflation is no longer the driving force behind Bitcoin\u2019s rally and Investors' focus shifted from the impact of inflationary pressure to potential recession risks after the banking crisis revealed how fragile the financial system was following the Federal Reserve's twelve-month hike in interest rates from 0.10% to 4.85%. Aside from the Silicon Valley Bank bankruptcy and the government-backed sale of Credit Suisse to UBS, several warning signs of a macroeconomic downturn have emerged. The most recent ISM Purchasing Managers Index data fell to its lowest level since May 2020, indicating an economic contraction. According to Federal Reserve documents released on April 12, the aftermath of the U.S. banking crisis is likely to push the economy into a \"mild recession\" later this year. Because of the crisis, some have speculated that the Fed will hold off on raising interest rates, but officials affirmed that more effort is needed to keep inflation under control. According to a Moody's Analytics report, commercial real estate prices fell 1.6% in February, the most since the 2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, the national office vacancy rate reached 16.5%, indicating the severity of the economic difficulties that businesses are currently facing. Whatever the reason for Bitcoin's 50% rally between March 11 and April 11, it demonstrates resilience to FUD, including the SEC's Wells Notice against Coinbase on March 22, and the CFTC filing a suit against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao on March 27. By holding the $30,000 support, Bitcoin demonstrates that the positive momentum can continue regardless of whether inflation remains above 5%. Not everyone is cheering the rally, particularly traders who have placed bearish bets using Bitcoin options. The April 14 open interest for BTC options expiry is $950 million, with $490 million in call (buy) options and $460 million in put (sell) options. Bears have been caught off guard, with less than 7% of their bets exceeding $29,000. Below are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of call (buy) and put (sell) options contracts available on April 14 varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit: This rough estimate considers only call options in bullish bets and put options in neutral-to-bearish trades. Nonetheless, this oversimplification excludes more complex investment strategies. A trader, for example, could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a certain price, but this effect is difficult to estimate. Related: Bitcoin-friendly PPI data boosts bulls as Ether price fights for $2K Bulls are expected to push Bitcoin above $30,500 on April 14 at 8:00 a.m UTC to profit an additional $100 million. Bears, on the other hand, would need to pressure Bitcoin's price below $29,000 in order to balance the scales. However, bears have recently suffered significant losses as BTC futures short contracts were forcibly liquidated to the tune of $128 million between April 9 and April 11. As the most likely scenario favors Bitcoin bulls, their profits will most likely be used to reinforce the $30,000 support. Bears might consider licking their wounds and waiting for additional actions from regulators as the macroeconomic scenario is currently bullish for supply capped assets.

                  "description": "You might think that new tax reporting rules for exchanges should mean less work for the taxpayer, but it\u2019s the opposite, says CPA Kirk Phillips.",
                  "content": "Kirk Phillips Kirk Phillips is a CPA, entrepreneur and founder of Global Crypto Advisors and Crypto Blocko, a business, accounting and tax resource site. This article is part of CoinDesk\u2019s Tax Week series. The U.S. Infrastructure and Jobs Act ushered in \u201cbroker reporting\u201d rules for centralized crypto exchanges, effectively turning digital assets into securities for purposes of the Section 6045 reporting requirement. Stock trading firms issue tax forms 1099-Bs with sales of securities and capital gains and losses, so centralized exchanges will do the same thing for crypto trades on the new Form 1099-DA. Cash App and Robinhood Crypto, for example, have already been issuing crypto trades on 1099-Bs for several years. This article is part of CoinDesk's Tax Guide 2023 . Kirk Phillips is an entrepreneur, Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and author of \"The Ultimate Bitcoin Business Guide: For Entrepreneurs & Business Advisors.\" At first glance it might seem like crypto reporting by exchanges means less work for the taxpayer, but it\u2019s the opposite. This creates a huge burden for centralized exchanges and saddles the taxpayer with a more onerous crypto tax reporting exercise. Taxpayers in other regimes that implement similar rules will suffer the same fate. Let\u2019s dig deeper and find out why. The U.S. has a voluntary tax compliance system where the taxpayer is responsible for calculating and filing their own taxes. Taxpayers report two kinds of information: The Internal Revenue Service matches amounts reported by third parties to make sure they\u2019re the same amounts reported by the taxpayer. Third-party tax forms include W-2s, 1099s, 1098s and so on. Taxpayers self-report any income, expenses or deductions not reported on third-party forms. Both of those reporting methods were completely separate until now. Crypto tax calculations were mostly the 100% self-reported variety, but the new broker reporting rules relegate taxpayers to a combination of third-party and self-reporting, and that\u2019s where the problem begins. Taxpayers will still manage their entire view of crypto tax calculations. Meanwhile, multiple exchanges will report their tiny view of a taxpayer\u2019s crypto landscape, leaving the taxpayer to piece together 1099-DAs and figure out whether they\u2019re correct. What\u2019s been described in these pages as \u201c The Maddening Task of Calculating Crypto Taxes \u201d is the first clue the new reporting rules will create more crypto tax headaches, not less. Taxpayers can easily rack up five to 10 times more wallets and exchange accounts than stock trading and bank accounts while having to untangle a web of crypto transactions contained within. Most crypto tax software providers deployed the universal cost basis feature that dumps all transactions into a single bucket for calculation purposes. Alice (not her real name!) has been in crypto for six years and accumulated seven exchange accounts and 13 wallets. The software commingles all her transactions from 2018 up to the current year and makes one calculation as if Alice was only using one wallet. Under the new rules, Alice would receive seven 1099-DAs in addition to her own universal calculation. Alice is no longer solely responsible for her crypto tax calculations and instead has eight parties, including herself, in on the calculation exercise. Alice has been calculating and self-reporting her crypto taxes on Form 8949 for years. She disregards the seven 1099-DAs because she\u2019s already included all her transactions in the current Form 8949. Alice files her tax return as usual and gets flustered after receiving an IRS notice saying she underreported income. Now Alice must amend her tax return and report the information as received on the 1099-DAs. Bob, on the other hand, has eight wallets and four exchange accounts. He reported four 1099-DAs on his tax return and deleted the transactions for those four exchanges from his crypto tax software. Bob thought this was a clever solution to avoid double-counting his exchange transactions, but he didn\u2019t realize two of the exchanges didn\u2019t report cost basis on 1099-DAs. As a result, he overstated his capital gains and significantly overpaid more tax than he should have. Bob and Alice have run headfirst into some of the numerous 1099-DA pitfalls. Now they must go through a rigorous exercise to reconcile all the 1099-DAs with their own universal calculation to double-check the exchanges correctly reported information. The challenge of managing crypto taxes just got magnified. In the absence of a thorough reconciliation and cross-checking exercise, taxpayers will otherwise double count and/or omit cost basis and therefore understate or overstate tax liabilities. Let\u2019s look at some other 1099-DA pitfalls. U.S. taxpayers can use FIFO, first in first out, or specific identification for crypto cost-basis methods just like securities sales. FIFO is simply a tracking method where the oldest crypto purchased is considered the first crypto sold and specific identification allows taxpayers to choose a specific batch of crypto to sell before selling it. In legacy finance, a taxpayer can give notice to their securities broker to use specific identification and then instruct the broker which tax lot of securities to sell. Specific identification doesn\u2019t work this way in crypto because both exchanges and crypto tax software don\u2019t provide any pre-sale identifying mechanisms. This means exchanges will default to providing FIFO-only cost basis on 1099-DAs. Meanwhile, taxpayers use several cost method methods, numerous other ways crypto is considered sold for tax purposes, as proxies for specific identification because the cost basis in the calculation is \u201cidentified\u201d after the sale instead of before. Nonetheless, if exchanges report on a FIFO basis and the taxpayer uses specific identification, then reconciling between the two will be impossible. This illustrates how cost basis would be double counted and/or omitted because the taxpayers and exchanges are using inconsistent cost basis methods. Cost-basis tracking on a per-wallet and exchange basis would help the reconciliation process but doesn\u2019t come without its own issues. Several crypto tax software providers, such as Cointracker and Bitwave, are rolling out per-wallet and exchange tracking and some already had these features. Alice has consistently used the FIFO cost basis method and wants to reconcile her 1099-DAs so she switches her crypto software from universal to per-wallet tracking. She\u2019s surprised to get different gains and losses for each tax year, but her new CPA explains the calculations go back to 2018 and the per-wallet method is recalculating what has already been calculated in prior years. Crypto software must lock down cost basis at the end of 2022, for example, so the shift to per wallet tracking avoids the double-counting and/or omissions dilemma. It\u2019s unclear how exchanges are going to manage customer basis and data tracking because 1099-DA reporting is currently deferred until final regulations are issued. One thing is clear, though \u2013 there will be differences and taxpayers will have extra work to correctly adjust gains and losses on their tax returns. Form 8949, used to report the detail all crypto trades, has adjustment codes to deal with incorrectly reported basis and other issues. However, this is easier said than done. In addition to the normal crypto tax headaches, taxpayers must track 1099-DA reconciliation differences, calculate adjustments and figure out reporting so final gains and losses are correct. There are also many other issues too numerous to mention here. Bob, a decentralized finance (DeFi) degen, wants to avoid the 1099-DA conundrums and decided to use his centralized exchanges as stablecoin-only on- and off-ramps and use DeFi protocols for all his other crypto activity. His 1099-DAs would only show stablecoin sales with gains and losses essentially zero, thus eliminating the reconciliation and adjustment exercise. Bob is going to minimize transfers among exchanges to keep activity as self-contained as possible. He\u2019s also considering opening new exchange accounts to containerize new trades and cost basis when 1099-DAs are finally issued. We need crypto tax management to get easier, not harder. The ideal compromise for final broker reporting rules would be removing the cost basis reporting requirement to eliminate most of the cost basis reconciliation headaches. Then taxpayers would only have to deal with reconciling reported proceeds from trades. Fortunately, the delay with 1099-DA will give more time for exchanges to develop better reporting, crypto tax software providers to develop more useful tracking features and taxpayers to strategize ways to minimize headaches.

                  "content": "A federal magistrate judge has signed an order requiring BitBoy Crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong to appear in Florida as part of a status conference related to a lawsuit involving several crypto influencers. In an April 12 filing in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Judge Melissa Damian ordered Armstrong and his counsel to appear on April 20 along with the legal team representing the influencers. According to the order, the conference was aimed at bringing awareness of \u201cArmstrong\u2019s harassment towards plaintiffs\u2019 counsel.\u201d Armstrong, along with several other YouTubers, were named in a $1-billion lawsuit filed on March 15 for allegedly promoting \u201cFTX crypto fraud without disclosing compensation.\u201d Adam Moskowitz, representing plaintiff Edwin Garrison and others in the class-action lawsuit, has claimed that Armstrong harassed the legal team with \u201cendless phone calls, tweets and emails,\u201d voicemails \u201cfull of vulgarities,\u201d and social media posts suggesting threats. An April 5 filing showing cause for a hearing with Armstrong detailed \u201cdaily violent threats\u201d by the YouTuber in addition to responses to emails with threats and insults before being served with process papers. The legal team also reported in a March 20 filing that one of Armstrong\u2019s voicemails included the YouTuber allegedly threatening to surround Moskowitz\u2019s home with protesters \u201c24/7 day and night.\u201d \u201cThe scope of the attacks (including death threats), which examples are provided in those filings and which continue on a daily basis since, necessitated Undersigned Counsel to open an FBI investigation into Armstrong, as well as the investigation files by local police authorities for Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and their families,\u201d said Moskowitz. Twitter posts from Armstrong claimed the original lawsuit regarding disclosure of compensation from FTX had \u201cabsolutely no merit.\u201d The crypto influencer is no stranger to online controversy, regularly insulting high-profile figures, including European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde and being generally dismissive of the class-action lawsuit. So let me get this straight\u2026 Adam Moskowitz frivolously attaches me falsely as a paid promoter of FTX, a site where people lot EVERYTHING\u2026 many lost life savings. Many on brink of suicide.

                  "content": "God save our gracious coin, and long live the coin. A team of entrepreneurs, environmentalists and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have assembled to back Bitcoin in Britain. Bitcoin Policy UK (BPUK) unites stakeholders, policymakers, environmentalists, tax specialists, Bitcoin experts and miners to \u201cunlock the potential of Bitcoin\u201d in Britain and explore how the decentralized currency\u2019s burgeoning industry could benefit U.K. households, businesses and communities. BPUK\u2019s primary objectives are to drive investment, generate and prepare students for the Bitcoin jobs of the future, raise awareness and education, and explore the use of wasted and stranded energy resources for Bitcoin mining. Freddie New, BPUK\u2019s head of policy, told Cointelegraph that \u201cthe genesis of this project was the Bitcoin Collective Conference in Edinburgh\u201d \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s largest Bitcoin conference, taking place in fall 2022 . New told Cointelegraph that most of the team had been working on Bitcoin advocacy in one way or another before the conference, \u201cbut coming together like this will enable us to formalize these efforts and focus on three key related areas.\u201d He continued: Some of the advisers and board members are familiar to Cointelegraph readers. Author and journalist DecentraSuze, whose son recently introduced Bitcoin to the classroom , is a director, while Jordan Walker, co-founder of The Bitcoin Collective , and Mark Morton are advisers. Morton\u2019s Bitcoin mining company, Scilling Digital Mining, was featured in a recent Cointelegraph mini-documentary: Walker told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is an important piece of the collective puzzle to drive Bitcoin education in the U.K.: New told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is not-for-profit. To operate, it hopes to raise funds through the community, tapping into the growing trend of funding projects with satoshis , or small amounts of BTC, via the Lightning Network, a layer-2 instant payment solution built atop Bitcoin. Part of the team\u2019s mission is to locate and harness renewable, wasted or stranded energy across the U.K., New explained. He continued with the plan: \u201cWe can then invite British policymakers to these sites so they can see mines in action and hopefully understand more about the industry\u2019s potential to mitigate vented methane, provide demand response for renewable grids, or simply act as a customer for energy that is otherwise wasted.\u201d The U.K. has burgeoning renewable energy sources but lacks in hash rate (a measure of the Bitcoin protocol\u2019s security). According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the U.K. supports 0.23% of the global monthly hash rate, compared with the United States\u2019 37.84%. This is partly due to electricity costs in the U.K. exceeding those of the U.S. and Asia, but also due to Bitcoin mining awareness \u2014 or a lack thereof \u2014 in the U.K. Moreover, legacy media platforms have taken aim at the Bitcoin mining industry in recent years \u2014 the Guardian critiqued Bitcoin as \u201cdigital beef\u201d instead of \u201cdigital gold.\u201d BPUK highlighted that in light of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union, it could develop a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency regime separate from that of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in Europe. The European parliamentary committee on MiCA may threaten Bitcoin mining on the continent . BPUK co-founder Krista Edmunds took inspiration from El Salvador\u2019s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Edmunds explained: On the governmental side, the policy group will have an opportunity to educate and inform. Lisa Cameron, a member of Parliament and chairperson of the Crypto and Digital Assets All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), told Cointelegraph in an interview last year: \u201cWe are on a learning curve, and it\u2019s just very, very important because the U.K. government has a policy vision that the U.K. will become an international hub of cryptocurrency and digital assets.\u201d She added that there was some confusion surrounding Bitcoin, central bank digital currencies and cryptocurrency. New explained that as a Bitcoin-only organization, the BPUK ultimately seeks to \u201cmake sure that Bitcoin is included in the government\u2019s proposals, if not at the front and center.\"",

                  "content": "By Elijah Asdourian, James Lee, Nasiha Salwati, Louise SheinerWhat\u2019s the latest thinking in fiscal and monetary policy? The Hutchins Roundup keeps you informed of the latest research, charts, and speeches. Want to receive the Hutchins Roundup as an email? Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday. Men, but not women, leave school when short-term earnings opportunities arise J\u00f3sef Sigurdsson of Stockholm University finds that a change to the Icelandic tax code led men to drop out of school without similarly affecting women. Iceland collected no income tax on earnings in 1987 as it changed its national taxation system, creating an opportunity for Icelanders to earn substantially more in the short term. Dropout rates for men who were just old enough to leave high school and start working were 5 percentage points higher than for men just below the cutoff, while dropout rates for women were unchanged. Dropouts rarely returned to school and suffered large losses in lifetime income despite higher earnings in the years after 1987. The findings indicate that short-term earnings opportunities affect men and women differently, suggesting \u201cgender differences in nonpecuniary costs of school attendance, myopia, or perceived returns to education.\u201d The tradeoff between inflation and labor market slack is higher in tight labor markets Using U.S. industry-level data over the 1959 to 2022 period, Simon C. Smith of the Federal Reserve Board, Allan Timmermann of the University of California, San Diego, and Jonathan H. Wright of Johns Hopkins University find that the Phillips Curve \u2013 the relationship between inflation and labor market slack \u2013 steepened in 1972 (meaning that inflation became more sensitive to slack) and flattened in 2001. The flattening was more pronounced for goods prices than service prices and concentrated in metropolitan areas with higher rates of import penetration from China. The authors also find that the Phillips Curve is nonlinear and steeper when the labor market is tight. A steeper Phillips Curve and a higher natural rate of unemployment can explain about half of the surge in prices over the 2020-2022 period, they find. Breaks in the slope of the Phillips Curve make pre-break data less informative for policymakers, causing them to be less certain about the relationship between the unemployment gap and inflation. To compensate for this additional caution, policymakers \u201crespond less aggressively to deviations in the unemployment gap but, conversely, respond more aggressively to deviations from target inflation,\u201d the authors say. China\u2019s growing role in cross-border rescue lending China\u2019s role as an international lender of last resort has grown exponentially in recent years, according to Sebastian Horn of the World Bank and co-authors. Since 2000, more than 20 debtor countries \u2014 primarily debtors of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative \u2014 have received $240 billion USD from the People\u2019s Bank of China in rescue lending \u2014 $170 billion USD via a global swap line that is quickly growing, and $70 billion USD in rescue loans for balance of payments support. Of this, $185 billion USD was lent between 2016 and 2021. China\u2019s overseas lending, the authors say, is making the international financial system more multipolar, less institutionalized, and less transparent. Chart of the week: Core services inflation remains high Chart courtesy of Jason Furman Quote of the week: \u201cWith financial instability contained, monetary policy should remain focused on bringing inflation down, but stand ready to quickly adjust to financial developments. A silver lining is that the banking turmoil will help slow aggregate activity as banks curtail lending. In and of itself, this should partially mitigate the need for further monetary tightening to achieve the same policy stance. But any expectation that central banks will prematurely surrender the inflation fight would have the opposite effect: lowering yields, supporting activity beyond what is warranted, and ultimately complicating the task of monetary authorities. Fiscal policy can also play an active role. By cooling off economic activity, tighter fiscal policy would support monetary policy, allowing real interest rates to return faster to a low natural level. Appropriately designed fiscal consolidation will also help rebuild much needed buffers and help strengthen financial stability. While fiscal policy is turning less expansionary in many countries this year, more could be done to regain fiscal space,\u201d says Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Economic Counsellor of the International Monetary Fund. \u201cOur latest projections also indicate an overall slowdown in medium-term growth forecasts. Five-year ahead growth projections declined steadily from 4.6% in 2011 to 3% in 2023. Some of this decline reflects the growth slowdown of previously rapidly growing economies such as China or Korea. This is predictable: growth slows down as countries converge. But some of the more recent slowdown may also reflect more ominous forces: the scarring impact of the pandemic, a slower pace of structural reforms, as well as the rising and increasingly real threat of geoeconomic fragmentation leading to more trade tensions, less direct investment, and a slower pace of innovation and technology adoption across fragmented \u2018blocks.\u2019 A fragmented world is unlikely to achieve progress for all, or to successfully tackle global challenges such as climate change or pandemic preparedness. We must avoid that path at all costs.\u201d The Brookings Institution is financed through the support of a diverse array of foundations, corporations, governments, individuals, as well as an endowment.
