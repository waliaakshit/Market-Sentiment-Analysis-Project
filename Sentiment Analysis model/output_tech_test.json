                  "content": "Russia is now ranking second in terms of energy capacities engaged in the extraction of cryptocurrencies, new data suggests. Despite persisting regulatory uncertainty and the negative effects of sanctions, the amount of power devoted to the sector has been growing, reaching record highs this year. 1 GW of Electrical Power Involved in Crypto Mining in Russia During Q1 of 2023 Russia has for the first time climbed to second place in the world in terms of total power capacity of the facilities devoted to the production of digital currencies. According to data provided by the country\u2019s largest mining operator, Bitriver, the amount of power involved in coin minting has reached 1 gigawatt (GW) in the first three months of the year. The United States remains the clear leader with 3 to 4 GW of mining capacity, the Russian business daily Kommersant reported. The top 10 also includes Gulf countries (700 MW), Canada (400 MW), Malaysia (300 MW), Argentina (135 MW), Iceland (120 MW), Paraguay (100\u2013125 MW), Kazakhstan (100 MW), and Ireland (90 MW), the newspaper detailed. Bitriver noted that the positive trend for Russia is linked to last year\u2019s reduction of mining activities in Kazakhstan, where authorities have been shutting down authorized mining data centers and going after illegal crypto farms due to electricity shortages. The Central Asian nation\u2019s growing power deficit has been blamed on the influx of miners following China\u2019s crackdown on the industry. A law limiting their access to low-cost, subsidized electricity entered into force in February. The U.S. also leads in terms of share of the global hashrate. However, the growth of the American market is being slowed down by rising electricity rates, reduced mining profitability, and the abolition of tax incentives in some areas, Bitriver CEO Igor Runets remarked and further commented: In addition, the vast majority of equipment was purchased by American miners on credit, so many over-leveraged companies are in the process of bankruptcy or have already gone bankrupt. The actions of U.S. regulators are also drawing the attention of market participants, added Roman Nekrasov, co-founder of Encry Foundation, which represents IT companies providing services in the field of blockchain and tech innovations. He believes they can provoke another major redistribution in the mining market. Data provided by the head of the Russian Association of Cryptoeconomics, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain (Racib), Alexander Brazhnikov, suggests that the energy capacity of Russia\u2019s crypto mining sector may be even higher. Quoted by the crypto news outlet Bits.media, he said that the Russians use about 800,000 ASIC miners, the combined power rating of which exceeds 2.5 GW. According to research published in August, the electricity consumption of Russian miners increased 20 times over the course of five years, between 2017 and 2022. The development of the industry in the country is facilitated by the availability of cheap energy resources and cool climates in regions such as Irkutsk. However, its future remains unclear in the absence of regulations. A bill designed to introduce rules for mining businesses is yet to be passed by the parliament in Moscow. Do you think Russia\u2019s crypto mining sector will continue to grow? Tell us in the comments section below.",

                  "content": "Amid the Collapse of Three U.S. Banks, Is the U.S. Petrodollar Facing the Same Fate? by Cameron Keegan April 9, 2023, 02:27 29 Views 5 Votes Considering the recent turmoil in the U.S. banking system, the trajectory of the global power of the U.S. dollar comes under scrutiny, as too, the economy of our entire country. In the past year, the upper echelons within the Western oil and gas industry have been observing a shift in global energy markets toward China, Russia and India. Indeed, amid the deepening conflict and escalating uncertainties between Ukraine and Russia, we have witnessed Western sanctions against Russia, and China and India\u2019s willingness to secure energy supplies at \u201cenormous discounts\u201d from the successor state to the former Soviet Union. However, might closer economic relations between Russia, and China and India\u2014but particularly China\u2014signal a trajectory in falling dominance for the U.S. dollar, which could profoundly impact the U.S. energy markets? To explore this wavering concern, let us firstly open a brief chapter in history. The U.S. dollar reigns supreme Before the onset of the 20th century, the value of a currency was pegged to the value of gold. As a result, a bank would have been limited by its gold reserves when providing a loan. Then, the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944 established a system where gold became the basis for the U.S. dollar, and consequently, other currencies were tied to the U.S. dollar\u2019s value\u2014those of 44 allied nations to be precise. But the Bretton Woods system formally ended in 1971 when U.S. President Richard Nixon announced that America would no longer exchange gold for U.S. currency, thus taking the country off the gold standard. Afterwards, the U.S. dollar spiralled into depreciation, but the sale of U.S. oil played an essential role in bolstering its value. In 1974, the Nixon administration cut a deal with Saudi Arabia, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Essentially, the Saudis would designate their crude oil sales in U.S. dollars and obtain American military supplies and equipment. Thus, consistent demand for the U.S. was ensured, especially as other OPEC members negotiated similar deals; hence the term \u201cpetrodollar\u201d was coined to denote U.S. dollars exchanged for crude oil exports. To this very day, the petrodollar still rules\u2014 yet, for how long though? Russia and China strike a closer economic relationship But the era where the U.S. dollar dominates has been in question year after year, not least due to increasing competition from China, which boasts the world\u2019s second-largest economy , the largest consumer of most commodities , and now, its expanding economic relationship with Russia\u2014more specifically, in guzzling up the Great Bear\u2019s crude oil at 40 percent discount . Indeed, by June 2022, China\u2019s spending on Russian energy had escalated to $25 billion since the warfare between Ukraine and Russia began in February, almost double the value of the same period in 2021. Since sanctions were placed by Western powers on Russia, be it the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union, Russia has been looking to the East to secure long-term sales in the energy market, particularly its largest export\u2014crude oil. As a result, its former Cold War rival, China, snapped up a record quantity of Russian crude oil in May 2022, raising purchases to $7.47 billion, about $1 billion more than the previous month and double that in 2021. Furthermore, Russia\u2019s state-owned energy operator Gazprom agreed to a 30-year contract with China National Petroleum Corporation in February 2022, with 10 billion cubic meters of annual gas set to flow through a new pipeline in the next few years. And in September 2022, the two state-owned energy giants agreed to use Russian roubles and Chinese yuan to pay for Russian gas supplies to China. How could this increasingly cozy economic relationship between China and Russia effect the value of the U.S. dollar? Impact on the U.S. dollar Suppose Russia and China are to continue trading crude oil in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. With China now the world\u2019s largest oil importer, what would be the trajectory of the dominance of the petrodollar\u2014and thus power for the U.S. alone? Furthermore, central banks worldwide are increasingly keen to hold China\u2019s yuan as a reserve currency. According to the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) Asset Management\u2019s annual reserve manager survey of June 2022, around 85 percent of central banks said they are invested or are considering investing in the yuan\u2014that\u2019s an increase of 81 percent compared to 2021. Moreover, the UBS report estimates that reserve managers at central banks, on average, are seeking to hold 5.8 percent of their reserves in China\u2019s currency in a decade, a sharp increase from the 2.8 percent level reported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in late December 2022. According to the IMF , as central banks look to diversify their holdings, the U.S. dollar\u2019s dominance has been dented due to a quarter of reserve managers turning to the Chinese yuan and three-quarters exploring currencies from nations that typically play limited roles as reserve assets. Furthermore, this major financial agency of the United Nations adds that: \u201cA characterization of the evolution of the international reserve system in the last 20 years is thus as ongoing movement away from the dollar, a recent if still modest rise in the role of the renminbi [Chinese yuan], and changes in market liquidity, relative returns and reserve management enhancing the attractions of nontraditional reserve currencies. These observations provide hints of how the international system may evolve going forward.\u201d Though the U.S. dollar remains the world\u2019s most prominent reserve currency, with central banks holding around 59 percent of their reserves in the dollar, for China to continue pushing the yuan to take on a more significant share of the global reserve currency, how will the U.S. ensure the top spot in the long term? Yet, despite the significance of the U.S. dollar in the global markets and despite the dollar being its strongest in two decades , it is ranked as the 9th strongest currency . In contrast, the Kuwaiti dinar has secured the top spot, while the British pound sterling and the Euro hold the 6th and 8th position, respectively. Historically, the U.S. dollar reached an all-time high in February 1985\u2014before a dramatic plunge by December 1987. Since then, the dollar has experienced steady waves. Thus far, the Chinese yuan hasn\u2019t made the top ten. But no doubt the Red Dragon is eager to rise and boost its currency. So how will the U.S. manage Chinese competition and retain the value of its greenbacks in the long term? While the strength of the dollar is holding\u2014albeit wavering\u2014it is still holding. But, now, how do we explain the latest debacle with three U.S. banks hitting rock bottom within days of each other? Three U.S. banks collapse within days On Sunday, March 12, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), U.S. Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a joint statement about New York City\u2019s Signature Bank\u2014that this leading institution in cryptocurrency lending \u201cclosed today by its state chartering authority.\u201d The statement went on to explain they would make a \u201csystemic risk exception\u201d for Signature and Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), a bank focused on the tech and startup sector that was also shut down , allowing both banks\u2019 clients to have full access to their deposits. They added that: \u201cAs with the resolution of [SVB], no losses will be borne by the taxpayer. Shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders will not be protected. Senior management has also been removed. Any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund to support uninsured depositors will be recovered by a special assessment on banks, as required by law.\u201d Signature served as one of the leading banks in the cryptocurrency industry\u2014the largest alongside Silvergate, which also announced its impending liquidation on March 8. As of December 31, 2022, Signature had $110.4 billion in total assets and $88.6 billion in total deposits, according to a securities filing. By March 10, it had a market value of $4.4 billion after a 40 percent sell-off this year, according to FactSet . While the go-to bank for tech startups, SVB, collapsed on March 10, Signature also saw its shares plunge following deposit outflows. New York state officials reportedly said closing the bank was made \u201c in light of market events \u201d to protect the bank\u2019s clients and prevent spreading the crisis throughout the financial system. Let us pause and recollect a series of extraordinary banking failures. First, California-based, crypto-focused Silvergate announced its upcoming liquidation. Second, SVB imploded only two days later, the largest U.S. bank collapse since the financial crisis of 2008. Third, Signature drowned another two days later. Yet despite sparked concerns, with many top lenders seeing their stocks plunge , President Joe Biden reassured Americans that the U.S. banking system is \u201csafe.\u201d President Biden says \u201cthe banking system is safe\u201d \u201cYour deposits are safe,\u201d Biden said in a March 13 set of remarks from the Roosevelt Room at the White House. \u201cLet me also assure you we will not stop at this. We will do whatever is needed on top of all this.\u201d By law, up to $250,000 is insured for each depositor\u2019s account in each bank. Still, the Biden administration and the Fed have announced they will make funding available to refund the startups and tech companies impacted by the bank closures. Biden had also noted in a March 12 statement on his administration\u2019s action to protect depositors at both banks, expressing he would hold those responsible for \u201cthis mess\u201d accountable for their actions. Indeed, the statement articulated that: \u201cOver the weekend, and at my direction, [Treasury Secretary Janet] Yellen and my National Economic Council Director worked with banking regulators to address problems at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. I am pleased that they reached a prompt solution that protects American workers and small businesses, and keeps our financial system safe. The solution also ensures that taxpayer dollars are not put at risk.\u201d This \u201cfunding\u201d to refund depositors from the Deposit Insurance Fund is financed primarily by the fees charged to banks after assessment, which can be traced to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 , following the Great Depression to protect depositors when their banks collapsed. \u201cManagement of these banks will be fired. If the bank is taken over by FDIC, the people running the bank should not work there anymore,\u201d Biden continued in his set of remarks, adding that investors would \u201cnot be protected\u201d because they were aware of the risks involved. U.S. bank stocks fall, and another 50 U.S. banks could fail While President Biden, a.k.a. \u201cGrandpa Joe,\u201d aimed to provide Americans with peace of mind about the state of the U.S. banking system, reports revealed that major U.S. bank stocks, including Western Alliance Bancorporation, Charles Schwab Corp., First Republic Bank and PacWest Bancorp dropped considerably in the pre-market trading hours on that very same day. Furthermore, according to former vice-president at Lehman Brothers Lawrence McDonald, another 50 U.S. regional lenders could fail amid rising banking uncertainty unless a \u201cstructural problem\u201d is fixed. The collapse of Lehman Brothers marked the beginning of the global financial crisis in 2008, in which the financial markets seized up and restrained international banks from obtaining U.S. dollars. During an interview with Russian news outlet RIA Novosti, McDonald accused the Fed and its Chairman Jerome Powell of having a lack of understanding over the risk of constant rate hikes for U.S. regional banks. Indeed, the Fed raised interest rates by 0.25 percent, the ninth increase in a year, attempting to counterbalance rising inflation with the latest turmoil in the banking system. McDonald went on to say: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be further damage. They [the Fed] have to cut rates and then they have to have a deposit guarantee, a larger one, that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to come up with\u2026 That\u2019s a bailout . That\u2019s basically the federal government taking on bank deposit risk.\u201d It could be argued that the Fed\u2019s decision to pump $2.3 trillion into the U.S. economy during the coronavirus lockdown might have been channelled into firms like SVB, which invested in the tech industry and created overvalued stock, and falsely inflated prices. Furthermore, this injection of trillions of dollars that landed in banks might have been invested in \u201csafe assets\u201d like bonds \u2014but those bonds didn\u2019t remain a reliable investment once the Fed began to raise rates, leading to the tumult of three U.S. banks collapsing within days. Well, as of March 16, the Fed announced the launch of an \u201cemergency loan program\u201d to inject funds worth $2 trillion into the U.S. banking system. So that\u2019s just great. No, wait, another 186 banks could fail According to a study , published by the Social Science Research Network on March 24, an additional 186 banks are at risk of collapse\u2014even if 50 percent of their depositors withdraw their funds. The paper, whose authors hail from the University of Southern California, Northwestern University, Columbia University and Stanford University, argues that the Fed\u2019s interest rate hikes to reduce inflation have diminished the value of bank assets such as government bonds , and asset-backed securities such as mortgage-backed securities . The authors conclude that: \u201cIf uninsured deposit withdrawals cause even small fire sales, substantially more banks are at risk. Overall, these calculations suggest that recent declines in bank asset values very significantly increased the fragility of the U.S. banking system to uninsured depositor runs.\u201d On this note, a coalition of midsize U.S. banks has asked regulators to extend FDIC insurance to all deposits for the next two years , asserting that the step is necessary to stabilize the banking sector and avoid a potential crisis. Let us remind ourselves that small and midsize banks account for over 50 percent of commercial and industrial lending, residential real estate lending and commercial real estate lending. If federal regulators do not commit to such an arrangement, a significantly vast amount of money, notwithstanding full authority or power, could be transferred from midsize banks to America\u2019s largest such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup. Midsize bank\u2019s shares fall despite an agreement to gain billions It was widely reported on March 16 that 11 U.S. banks agreed to deposit $30 billion with midsize lender First Republic Bank , probably as an attempt to dampen panic among depositors fleeing regional banks. The lenders said in a statement that regional, midsize and small banks are \u201ccritical to the health and functioning of our financial system.\u201d Bank of America, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Wells Fargo will inject $5 billion each, while Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will deposit $2.5 billion each. In addition, five other banks pledged deposits totaling $5 billion. In another joint statement , Yellen, Powell, FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg and Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu praised the banks\u2019 decision, noting \u201cthe show of support by a group of large banks is most welcome, and demonstrates the resilience of the banking system.\u201d Despite the move from the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks, First Republic struggled, with its shares falling to all time new lows on March 20. It goes without saying that the federal government will attempt to infuse \u201ccalm\u201d into Americans worried about bank deposits\u2014and subsequently, our financial security. According to Sara Devereux, global head of investing giant Vanguard\u2019s fixed-income group, recent events reflect a \u201csentiment contagion\u201d rather than the \u201ctrue systemic contagion\u201d observed during the 2008 financial crisis. Label recent events as you will. But correct predictions have been made; for example, investor Robert Kiyosaki said during a March 14 interview with Fox Business , \u201cI think the next bank to go is Credit Suisse\u2026because the bond market is crashing.\u201d Indeed, by March 16, Credit Suisse became the first major global bank to take up an emergency lifeline ; the investment bank announced it would borrow $54 billion from the Swiss central bank to avert liquidity after its shares and bonds plunged to a record low. Events are not so random. Be prepared. By: Cameron Keegan Cameron Keegan is an independent researcher and writer on American politics, faith, and culture through a conservative disposition.

                  "content": "PRESS RELEASE. It truly is time to rejoice now that .btc domains have come to Bitcoin. BTCDomain is a user-friendly domain system built on Bitcoin that allows users to begin registering, trading, and searching .btc domain names. By combining Ordinals and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technologies, they can securely store all of their metadata on the Bitcoin network while consistently maintaining the integrity of their domain registrar and resolver. Why Are Blockchain Domains Important? A domain serves as a symbol of an individual\u2019s personal identity. The simplicity of using a.btc domain for transactions not only prevents transfer errors caused by complicated wallet addresses, but it also protects users from clipboard replacement attacks, which change wallet addresses during the copy-paste process and is one of the most common and recurring fraudulent acts. A memorable domain name is also essential for effective marketing and brand awareness for businesses and brands. A distinctive domain name can therefore provide a significant competitive advantage for brands looking to stand out in an age of information overload. Put simply, a great domain name could potentially make all the difference in an age where online competition is at an all time high. Storing Data On The Bitcoin Network First and foremost, it is important to remember that the Bitcoin network does not support smart contracts. Bitcoin\u2019s embedded programming language is Bitcoin Script, which allows for programmable payment functionality. However, it is not a Turing-complete programming language; its definition and functions are primarily intended for completing various payment scenarios and are incapable of handling more complicated business logic. So, how does BTCDomain actually store data on the BTC network? The solution is to use ordinals technology. Ordinals distinguish these Satoshis by assigning sequential numbers to 1 BTC, which is equivalent to 100 million Satoshis. Satoshis can be assigned a stable identifier by using their sequence numbers. Ordinals refer to this \u201cattachment\u201d action as \u201cinscribing,\u201d which is similar to the process of minting Ethereum NFTs. Moreover, because all inscription data is stored on the blockchain rather than on external storage such as IPFS or AWS S3, it is truly decentralized and preserved in the blockchain alongside all other Bitcoin transactions. To achieve this, .btc domains are inscribed as formatted JSON text onto the Bitcoin mainnet, with each domain being a unique inscription that is akin to a BTC NFT. Do Not Trust, Just Verify Here is an example of how to decode satoshi.btc data from the Bitcoin Network. Click the genesis transaction history of satoshi.btc or use any Bitcoin explorer to examine transaction \u201c4d8cf99819690c37fcd62b63f3b7f357da71fd7f5c0de058f60180545f44fc63\u201d.Turn it into JSON view. After this step, simply copy the second part in \u201cwitness\u201d part and then paste it into any \u201chex to string converter\u201d tool. If done correctly, it becomes possible to see the metadata of this satoshi.btc. Users\u2019 domain metadata will be securely stored within the Bitcoin network for as long as it exists. Furthermore, each Bitcoin full node maintains a copy of a user\u2019s valuable domain name, ensuring its longevity and accessibility. Also, you could search more domain\u2019s metadata via btcdomains.io. Using \u201cInscription id\u201d without the \u201ci0\u201d at the end as transaction hash, you could examine any registered domain\u2019s metadata on the bitcoin chain. Unlocking .btc Domain Trading with Bitcoin Transactions & PSBT If the question revolves around how to trade .btc domains, the answer is found in Bitcoin transactions. Users\u2019 domains are linked to Satoshis via their sequence numbers, as previously stated. When users send Satoshis to someone else, the associated inscription is also transferred. This procedure makes domain trading easier. Also, \u2018Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions\u2019 (PSBT) are a useful feature of Bitcoin. This feature allows users to trade selected Satoshis with anyone who has a specific amount of BTC. They can participate in user-friendly trading on Ordinals trading platforms such as MagicEden by leveraging PSBT. Overall, the trading experience is indeed comparable to Ethereum, with the main point of difference being that this is for Bitcoin instead. Bolstering Security & Trust With Zero-Knowledge Tech In order to address the concerns about malicious data servers and the need for high trust in domains, it is critical to consider the potential consequences of a server misusing its power and redirecting BTC to unintended recipients. To address this issue, BTCDomain uses ZK technology. Using advanced mathematical methods, ZK technology ensures a trustworthy computing environment. It enables programs to run on a single computer and generate both output and a ZK proof. Anyone can confidently confirm that the program was executed without tampering by verifying the ZK proof. This additional layer of protection can keep data servers from performing unauthorized actions. Put simply, ZK technology creates a trusted environment which protects against malicious behavior and ensures transaction integrity. When combined with Ordinal\u2019s ability to make Bitcoin a data-available chain, it allows for the creation of a system that functions similarly to smart contracts while relying solely on Bitcoin. Users can hence have greater confidence in the system\u2019s security and reliability with ZK technology in place. BTCDomain: Pioneering A New Era Of Decentralized Domains & Enhanced Security On Bitcoin To sum it up, by introducing the innovative concept of .btc domains, BTCDomain is revolutionizing the Bitcoin ecosystem. In this way, BTCDomain creates a decentralized, safe, and user-friendly environment for registering, trading, and searching.btc domain names by leveraging Ordinals and Zero-Knowledge technologies. This breakthrough has the potential to reshape individuals\u2019 and businesses\u2019 online identities, making transactions more simple and secure. Besides that, the frictionless trading experience of inscriptions via Bitcoin transactions and PSBT, combined with the robust security provided by ZK technology, pave the way for a new era in the blockchain domain landscape. BTCDomain thus ushers in a bright future for the Bitcoin network by combining the benefits of Ordinals and ZK technology, one that bears a strong resemblance to smart contract functionality while remaining true to Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature. In conclusion, embracing BTCDomain is a significant step toward greater adoption and usability because it bridges the gap between blockchain and the traditional Internet infrastructure.

Also, DOE today announced a $54 million funding opportunity from the Law to expand the IAC Program to community colleges, trade schools, and union training programs, and create new Building Training and Assessment Centers ( BTACs ) at higher education institutions. Both announcements advance the Department\u2019s mission to streamline the career pipeline for students looking to join the clean energy economy, part of the Biden\u2013Harris Administration\u2019s actions to achieve net-zero emissions no later than 2050 while supporting workers and communities. \u201cStrengthening and diversifying the pipeline for high-quality manufacturing and building efficiency jobs is part of President Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda to create an economy that will allow our nation to reach its clean energy future,\u201d said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. \u201cThis is a direct investment in the next generation of American workers that will help ensure America\u2019s global leadership in advanced manufacturing and green building technologies.\u201d President Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda is growing the American economy from the bottom up and middle-out \u2014 from rebuilding our nation\u2019s infrastructure, to creating a manufacturing and innovation boom powered by good-paying jobs that don\u2019t require a four-year degree, to building a clean-energy economy that will combat climate change and make our communities more resilient. IAC Regional Centers of Excellence Selectees DOE\u2019s Industrial Assessment Centers (IAC) Over more than four decades, the IAC Program has provided more than 20,000 assessments at small- and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs), which comprise more than 90% of the nation\u2019s manufacturing base. IACs typically identify more than $130,000 in potential annual savings opportunities for every manufacturer assessed. Today, DOE-supported IACs exist at 37 universities in 28 states across the country, with 17 of those institutions having participated in a pilot to provide similar assessments to small and medium-sized commercial buildings. The new Regional Centers of Excellence will enhance and expand the IAC Program by serving as regional hubs for the program that collaborate and coordinate with government, nonprofit, labor, and industry actors to train clean energy workers and support small- and medium-sized manufacturers in each respective regions. Two of the five selectees, and seven of the partnering institutions, are Minority-Serving Institutions (MSI). Each of the selectees will bring unique capabilities in strengthening the IAC network: Great Plains Center of Excellence at Oklahoma State University (Stillwater, OK), in partnership with Northern Oklahoma College, Wichita State University, and the University of Nebraska, will advance the IAC network\u2019s use of technology-driven assessments \u2014 including through use of mobile applications, drones, and virtual/augmented reality. This center will also deepen the IAC network\u2019s partnerships with community colleges and Tribal communities. Southeastern Center of Excellence at Georgia Tech University (Atlanta, GA), in partnership with Clark Atlanta University, Florida A&M University, and Kennesaw State University, will draw on these universities\u2019 internationally renowned expertise in energy management, industrial electrification, and complex assessments. Mid-Atlantic Center of Excellence at Lehigh University (Bethlehem, PA), in partnership with West Virginia University, will expand the IAC network\u2019s engagement with unions, trade schools, and community colleges, and develop new assessment methodologies to better serve small manufacturers. Gulf Coast Center of Excellence at Texas A&M University (College Station, TX), a national leader in remote and hybrid assessments, will accelerate the IAC network\u2019s growing emphasis on industrial decarbonization, electrification, and resiliency planning. Western Center of Excellence at San Francisco State University (San Francisco, CA), in partnership with San Jose State University, San Diego State University, Laney College, and Cuyamaca College \u2014 a group of five leading minority-serving institutions \u2014 will apply their expertise in data-driven tracking to evaluate and improve manufacturer performance, renewable energy, energy demand management, thermal systems design, and waste and water management to enhance manufacturing competitiveness across the Western U.S. Learn more about each selection here . Funding Opportunity Announcement : $54 Million to Expand IACs and Create BTACs The new IACs and BTACs that will be created with this funding will build upon the demonstrated success of applied learning environments and hands-on training approaches of existing IACs. The IACs also will draw on the unique strengths, geographic reach, and faculty/student composition of trade schools, community colleges, union training programs, and other institutions of higher education. The new IACs will focus on high-quality skilled trades job pathways in fields, such as industrial electrician, energy management, renewable energy , and advanced manufacturing, while providing hands-on support to small and medium manufactures. The new BTACs will expand these benefits to commercial and institutional buildings to help lower utility costs and allow companies to reinvest in businesses, employees, and community services. The BTACs will train engineers, architects, building scientists, building energy permitting and enforcement officials, and building technicians in energy-efficient building design and operation. The IAC and BTAC programs will provide services in historically underserved communities and support DOE\u2019s work toward honoring the President\u2019s Justice40 Initiative. An informational webinar on the funding opportunity will be held on April 18, 2023 at 2:00 p.m. ET. Concept papers are required and are due on May 25, 2023 at 5 p.m. ET, with full applications due on July 31, 2023 at 5 p.m. ET. DOE\u2019s Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC) manages the IAC Program, and the Office of State and Community Energy Programs (SCEP) manages the BTAC Program.

                  "content": "The new R&D law has overly broad language that states \u201cany and all\u201d software development must be amortized over five years if the development took place in the United States, or over 15 years if the work was done overseas. The change doesn\u2019t sound so bad on its surface; some argue it might even create more tech jobs in the U.S. But that isn\u2019t how it will play out. Many countries have better R&D credits than the U.S. Much of U.S. software development will shift to countries such as the United Kingdom, where the rules are simple r and more lucrative. For tax-smart companies, U.S. entities will just be for marketing and sales. Imagine a company that lost over a million dollars but owes over $300,000 in taxes! How is this possible? This hypothetical company has roughly $2.5 million in income and, in 2022, spent $1.5 million building its software and $1 million in other costs, meaning it had a negative cashflow totaling $1 million dollars. However, because the $1.5 million of development was done by a team in India, it will only see $50,000 from the software development side, leaving a $1,050,000 deduction to offset the $2.5 million of income this year \u2014 meaning it owes tax on $1,450,000 in net income, or a bankrupting $304,500 in tax! Proponents of this tax say companies will still receive all the benefits of the deduction \u2014 just over many years. Put one of these proponents in front of a company that lost a million on operations but owes $300,000 in taxes and see if they say the same thing. Cashflow is king for finding startup success, and these types of R&D costs have been deducted nearly as long as the United States has had an income tax because of how vitally important innovation is to fueling national growth. With the current climate of high-interest rates and increased regulation, this law change will kill the most creative development in the U.S. on future-thinking technologies, such as AI and blockchain. Some of the Big Tech layoffs taking place may be a result of this rule change. No surprise: It makes more sense to restructure so that subsidiaries outside the U.S. do R&D. For blockchain, crypto, and nonfungible token (NFT) companies that already have to deal with all the Securities and Exchange Commission scrutiny, it just seems a no-brainer to distance from the U.S. now. Related: Get ready for a swarm of incompetent IRS agents in 2023 There are so many complications and unanswered questions of how to apply this law that it\u2019s head-spinning. For example, if you use a computer, server, miner, etc., for your R&D that you are depreciating, that portion of depreciation you would be able to take in 2022 must be added to the capitalization bucket to amortize out. This means if you were using this utility in the U.S. and expected to have $50,000 in depreciation come through from that equipment to deduct this year, you would only see $5,000 of that actually affect the bottom line. This really negates the purpose of special depreciation rules that encourage companies to spend on equipment, but then doesn\u2019t actually let them see the deduction. Another big risk with this law is if you raise money and develop with a big loss and no current income. Initially, this wouldn\u2019t hurt you \u2014 but if your company fails, you are in for a world of pain, because the cancellation of debt income from a SAFE note that was not repaid can trigger taxes if there are no net operating loss carryovers to fully offset. And there is no way, currently, to accelerate the R&D amortization; even if a project is abandoned or a company shuts down, the expenditure cannot be taken immediately. That means equity investors may not get back funds they should receive. Instead, the money in the treasury will go to paying taxes for a failed company while founders who received salaries may even be on the hook for the tax liability or repaying investors. Related: Biden is hiring 87,000 new IRS agents \u2014 and they\u2019re coming for you Everyone in government and the tax industry knew these laws were a mess, and they were set to be repealed by a bipartisan supported bill in Congress on Jan. 3. But the effort failed because Democrats wanted to increase the Child Tax Credit \u2014 at the last minute \u2014 after everything had been agreed, and Republicans wouldn't go along with it. Now, it seems we are stuck with this crazy innovation-killing tax law. A repeal proposal has been reintroduced but hasn\u2019t gained much traction. Especially in light of the current fundraising challenges for blockchain companies caused by increased interest rates, the crypto winter, and the Silicon Valley Bank failure, we may see a massive and unnecessary die-off of tech companies, unless some major action is taken by Congress quickly.

                  "description": "The roots of an hour-long surge were difficult to pinpoint, according to one analyst, but investors have recently been more optimistic about the crypto\u2019s prospects following last month\u2019s banking crisis.",
                  "content": "James Rubin James Rubin is CoinDesk's U.S. news editor based on the West Coast. Follow @ @JPRubin23 on Twitter For a while Monday, even as large parts of the world were off work celebrating Easter Monday, bitcoin (BTC) seemed headed for a promised land above $30,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which just three weeks ago had teased a run toward this threshold, topped $29,744 in the afternoon, its highest level since early June, amid a surge in investor optimism. But the cause of the move was difficult to pinpoint. It was currently trading at $29,616. From about 10 a.m to 11 a.m. ET (14:00-15:00 UTC), bitcoin rose nearly 4%. It had been lingering closer to $28,000 since mid-March, when fears about the conventional banking system began to diminish. \u201cThere isn't a clear catalyst for this spike,\u201d Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk, although he said that the surge might stem partly from \u201cbuying from crypto traders voicing frustration on social media over a one-sided New York Times article that took issue over [bitcoin's] energy consumption.\u201d Moya also noted that the move higher \u201coccurred around the release of news that Federal Home Loan Bank debt issuance had lessened, signaling that \u201cthe banking crisis was easing.\u201d Ether (ETH) also jumped, crossing the $1,900 level before retreating. It was recently up about 1.7% versus 24 hours earlier. Other major cryptos were largely in the green, albeit light shades. ARB, the token of layer 2 blockchain Arbitrum, was recently up more than 2.8%, while XRP rose about 1%. The CoinDesk Market Index , a measure of the crypto market's overall performance, recently rose 2.3%. Equity indexes closed roughly flat with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rising a few ticks of a percentage point, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite losing 0.03%. Crypto-related stocks enjoyed a memorable day with crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and corporate bitcoin vault MicroStrategy (MSTR) both rising more than 7.5%. Markets will be eyeing the March Consumer Price March Index (CPI) report this week for signs that inflation is continuing its recent trudge downward. In February, inflation in the U.S. slowed to 0.4% from 0.5% a month earlier and 6% on a yearly basis from 6.4% the previous month. Bitcoin jumped past $26,000 following that report, on March 14. A continued slowdown could embolden central bankers to scale back their year-long regime of harsh interest rate hikes, although the impact on bitcoin is uncertain. The crypto seemed to gain momentum following the recent U.S. bank failures that caused worries about the conventional financial system, as investors shifted toward assets that retain value through good times and bad. Investors will also be weighing the first wave of quarterly earnings with banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup scheduled to report results. Analysts are expecting a largely downcast quarter, particularly in the hard-hit financial services sector. \u201cBTC is also being seen as a reliable store of value that lacks the issues that come with storing your money by way of a third-party intermediary, or a bank,\u201d Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO and chief legal officer of Banxa , a payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider to the crypto industry, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. \u201cThis is further supported by the decreasing correlation with the equity markets since 2021 \u2013 BTC is now properly starting to be perceived as a risk-off asset.\u201d Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, was cautiously optimistic about the sustainability of bitcoin\u2019s Monday surge. \u201cBitcoin is likely to find resistance at $30,000,\u201d DiPasquale noted in an email to CoinDesk. From a technical-analysis perspective, the current move is \u201ca retest of the range high established in March after the initial surge from under $20,000. Success of this test would see the price claiming $30,000 while a failure here should see BTC drop to $25,000, followed by $23,000.\u201d But he added: \u201cThe current price is also testing the lows of July 2021, where the market bounced back into another big rally.\u201d UPDATE (April 10, 2023, 22:27 UTC): Updates with bitcoin's most recent prices.

                  "content": "YouTube, which will offer NFL Sunday Ticket this fall after its three-decade exclusive run on DirecTV came to an end, has revealed initial pricing for the package. In a blog post, YouTube said it will give YouTube TV subscribers a chance to add Sunday Ticket for $249 for the season, a savings of $100. The discount is available through June 6. With the reduction, the price is lower than the roughly $300 charged by DirecTV in recent seasons. YouTube paid more than $2 billion a year for the rights to Sunday Ticket for seven years. It will distribute it both as an add-on to YouTube TV and a stand-alone offering via its Primetime Channels hub, the first time it will be available without a pay-TV subscription. Not surprisingly, the price is significantly higher on an \u00e0 la carte basis. On Primetime Channels, NFL Sunday Ticket is available during the presale at $349 for the season, which is $100 off the regular retail price of $449. Related Story Most Moviegoers Will Still Go To Theaters Even If What They're Seeing Will Soon Be Streaming - Study The move from linear to streaming is a major shift for the package, which was rolled out in the 1990s and quickly became a subscription driver for DirecTV as the satellite operator was on the rise. Today, the NFL is increasingly looking to profit from the live sports appetites of deep-pocketed tech companies, locking an 11-year deal with Amazon Prime Video for Thursday Night Football beginning last season. In addition to the $100 discount for YouTube TV subscribers, a bundle of NFL Sunday Ticket and NFL Redzone \u2014 a popular whip-around show featuring highlights of scoring plays across the league \u2014 will go for $289, also a $100 savings. On Primetime Channels, the Sunday Ticket-Redzone bundle will cost $389 during the presale, compared to the regular price of $489. Christian Oestlien, VP of Product Management, YouTube TV and Connected TV, said features on YouTube TV are being incorporated into Sunday Ticket, including a \u201cmulti-view\u201d option to have multiple games on a single screen. Subscribers will also be able to access highlights of key plays, he said, and additional shopping, fantasy sports and data elements are in the works. YouTube parent Alphabet disclosed last summer that YouTube TV had passed 5 million subscribers, making it one of the top pay-TV providers in the U.S.",

Follow @ jackschickler on Twitter A \"rough year\" for crypto markets has underlined the need for comprehensive and consistent regulation of the sector, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said, suggesting stablecoin issuers and crypto conglomerates need to have bank-style capital requirements. In its \"Global Financial Stability Report\" published Tuesday, the IMF joins the standard setters at the Financial Stability Board in calling for consistent international regulation of the cryptocurrency sector after a year that has seen a number of collapses of major exchanges and crypto-linked banks. \u201cThe collapse of multiple entities in the crypto asset ecosystem has again made the call more urgent for comprehensive and consistent regulation and adequate supervision\u201d focused on protecting consumers and corporate governance, the report said. The report added that regulations should cover crypto storage, transfer, exchange and custody of reserves, with extra prudential requirements for those carrying out multiple functions and for the issuers of stablecoins \u2013 tokens that seek to maintain their value versus fiat currencies. The report cites a \u201crough year for crypto,\u201d in which the collapse of crypto- and tech-heavy lenders Silvergate, Signature and Silicon Valley Banks followed from the bankruptcy of the FTX crypto exchange in November. \u201cThese events add to questions about the viability of digital assets and reinforce the need for appropriate regulation,\u201d the IMF said. The IMF\u2019s report followed a warning issued earlier Tuesday by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) that financial authorities need to be able to monitor crypto leverage, decentralized finance and crypto staking and lending. \"Crypto-assets have experienced exponential growth in recent years, and the future development path of this market is uncertain,\u201d said a statement by the ESRB, a watchdog agency chaired by the European Central Bank\u2019s Christine Lagarde. The Financial Stability Board, a grouping of international regulators, is due to issue its own crypto rules in July, and its head, Klaas Knot, has already said many existing stablecoins would be unlikely to meet its strictures . Many traditional finance players want to see curbs on crypto conglomerates because the mixing of different financial functions could lead to conflicts of interest , despite concerns about constraining innovation. The IMF\u2019s Executive Board has previously expressed concerns over the potential of crypto to usurp the role of legal tender , though it stopped short of calling for an outright ban on digital assets.

Lace is a browser-based wallet similar to the popular MetaMask product. It allows users to access the Cardano network directly and use Cardano-based decentralized applications . Users can send and receive Cardano digital assets like ADA, Cardano non-fungible tokens and Cardano-native tokens. They can also stake ADA directly from the wallet to contribute to the security of the network and receive rewards for their participation, Lace will enable users to send multiple assets to different addresses in one transaction \u2013 with one transaction fee \u2013 through a new \"bundle transaction\" feature, which groups transactions into one bundle to save costs. Developers said they expect to add fiat-to-crypto on-ramps, a dapp store, in-wallet swaps and staking enchantments in future releases. Wallet services such as Lace may allow users to easily access decentralized-finance tools and be incentivized for using services on any blockchain, which may boost the token ecosystem for that network as it attracts traders hunting for opportunities that may have worn off on other networks.

                  "description": "A change to R&D tax rules means that a tech company could lose more than $1 million \u2014 but still be on the hook for hundreds of thousands in taxes.",
                  "content": "The new R&D law has overly broad language that states \u201cany and all\u201d software development must be amortized over five years if the development took place in the United States, or over 15 years if the work was done overseas. The change doesn\u2019t sound so bad on its surface; some argue it might even create more tech jobs in the U.S. But that isn\u2019t how it will play out. Many countries have better R&D credits than the U.S. Much of U.S. software development will shift to countries such as the United Kingdom, where the rules are simple r and more lucrative. For tax-smart companies, U.S. entities will just be for marketing and sales. Imagine a company that lost over a million dollars but owes over $300,000 in taxes! How is this possible? This hypothetical company has roughly $2.5 million in income and, in 2022, spent $1.5 million building its software and $1 million in other costs, meaning it had a negative cashflow totaling $1 million dollars. However, because the $1.5 million of development was done by a team in India, it will only see $50,000 from the software development side, leaving a $1,050,000 deduction to offset the $2.5 million of income this year \u2014 meaning it owes tax on $1,450,000 in net income, or a bankrupting $304,500 in tax! Proponents of this tax say companies will still receive all the benefits of the deduction \u2014 just over many years. Put one of these proponents in front of a company that lost a million on operations but owes $300,000 in taxes and see if they say the same thing. Cashflow is king for finding startup success, and these types of R&D costs have been deducted nearly as long as the United States has had an income tax because of how vitally important innovation is to fueling national growth. With the current climate of high-interest rates and increased regulation, this law change will kill the most creative development in the U.S. on future-thinking technologies, such as AI and blockchain. Some of the Big Tech layoffs taking place may be a result of this rule change. No surprise: It makes more sense to restructure so that subsidiaries outside the U.S. do R&D. For blockchain, crypto, and nonfungible token (NFT) companies that already have to deal with all the Securities and Exchange Commission scrutiny, it just seems a no-brainer to distance from the U.S. now. Related: Get ready for a swarm of incompetent IRS agents in 2023 There are so many complications and unanswered questions of how to apply this law that it\u2019s head-spinning. For example, if you use a computer, server, miner, etc., for your R&D that you are depreciating, that portion of depreciation you would be able to take in 2022 must be added to the capitalization bucket to amortize out. This means if you were using this utility in the U.S. and expected to have $50,000 in depreciation come through from that equipment to deduct this year, you would only see $5,000 of that actually affect the bottom line. This really negates the purpose of special depreciation rules that encourage companies to spend on equipment, but then doesn\u2019t actually let them see the deduction. Another big risk with this law is if you raise money and develop with a big loss and no current income. Initially, this wouldn\u2019t hurt you \u2014 but if your company fails, you are in for a world of pain, because the cancellation of debt income from a SAFE note that was not repaid can trigger taxes if there are no net operating loss carryovers to fully offset. And there is no way, currently, to accelerate the R&D amortization; even if a project is abandoned or a company shuts down, the expenditure cannot be taken immediately. That means equity investors may not get back funds they should receive. Instead, the money in the treasury will go to paying taxes for a failed company while founders who received salaries may even be on the hook for the tax liability or repaying investors. Related: Biden is hiring 87,000 new IRS agents \u2014 and they\u2019re coming for you Everyone in government and the tax industry knew these laws were a mess, and they were set to be repealed by a bipartisan supported bill in Congress on Jan. 3. But the effort failed because Democrats wanted to increase the Child Tax Credit \u2014 at the last minute \u2014 after everything had been agreed, and Republicans wouldn't go along with it. Now, it seems we are stuck with this crazy innovation-killing tax law. A repeal proposal has been reintroduced but hasn\u2019t gained much traction. Especially in light of the current fundraising challenges for blockchain companies caused by increased interest rates, the crypto winter, and the Silicon Valley Bank failure, we may see a massive and unnecessary die-off of tech companies, unless some major action is taken by Congress quickly.

                  "description": "The roots of an hour-long surge were difficult to pinpoint, according to one analyst, but investors have recently been more optimistic about the crypto\u2019s prospects following last month\u2019s banking crisis.",
                  "content": "James Rubin James Rubin is CoinDesk's U.S. news editor based on the West Coast. Follow @ @JPRubin23 on Twitter For a while Monday, even as large parts of the world were off work celebrating Easter Monday, bitcoin (BTC) seemed headed for a promised land above $30,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which just three weeks ago had teased a run toward this threshold, topped $29,744 in the afternoon, its highest level since early June, amid a surge in investor optimism. But the cause of the move was difficult to pinpoint. It was currently trading at $29,616. From about 10 a.m to 11 a.m. ET (14:00-15:00 UTC), bitcoin rose nearly 4%. It had been lingering closer to $28,000 since mid-March, when fears about the conventional banking system began to diminish. \u201cThere isn't a clear catalyst for this spike,\u201d Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk, although he said that the surge might stem partly from \u201cbuying from crypto traders voicing frustration on social media over a one-sided New York Times article that took issue over [bitcoin's] energy consumption.\u201d Moya also noted that the move higher \u201coccurred around the release of news that Federal Home Loan Bank debt issuance had lessened, signaling that \u201cthe banking crisis was easing.\u201d Ether (ETH) also jumped, crossing the $1,900 level before retreating. It was recently up about 1.7% versus 24 hours earlier. Other major cryptos were largely in the green, albeit light shades. ARB, the token of layer 2 blockchain Arbitrum, was recently up more than 2.8%, while XRP rose about 1%. The CoinDesk Market Index , a measure of the crypto market's overall performance, recently rose 2.3%. Equity indexes closed roughly flat with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rising a few ticks of a percentage point, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite losing 0.03%. Crypto-related stocks enjoyed a memorable day with crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and corporate bitcoin vault MicroStrategy (MSTR) both rising more than 7.5%. Markets will be eyeing the March Consumer Price March Index (CPI) report this week for signs that inflation is continuing its recent trudge downward. In February, inflation in the U.S. slowed to 0.4% from 0.5% a month earlier and 6% on a yearly basis from 6.4% the previous month. Bitcoin jumped past $26,000 following that report, on March 14. A continued slowdown could embolden central bankers to scale back their year-long regime of harsh interest rate hikes, although the impact on bitcoin is uncertain. The crypto seemed to gain momentum following the recent U.S. bank failures that caused worries about the conventional financial system, as investors shifted toward assets that retain value through good times and bad. Investors will also be weighing the first wave of quarterly earnings with banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup scheduled to report results. Analysts are expecting a largely downcast quarter, particularly in the hard-hit financial services sector. \u201cBTC is also being seen as a reliable store of value that lacks the issues that come with storing your money by way of a third-party intermediary, or a bank,\u201d Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO and chief legal officer of Banxa , a payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider to the crypto industry, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. \u201cThis is further supported by the decreasing correlation with the equity markets since 2021 \u2013 BTC is now properly starting to be perceived as a risk-off asset.\u201d Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, was cautiously optimistic about the sustainability of bitcoin\u2019s Monday surge. \u201cBitcoin is likely to find resistance at $30,000,\u201d DiPasquale noted in an email to CoinDesk. From a technical-analysis perspective, the current move is \u201ca retest of the range high established in March after the initial surge from under $20,000. Success of this test would see the price claiming $30,000 while a failure here should see BTC drop to $25,000, followed by $23,000.\u201d But he added: \u201cThe current price is also testing the lows of July 2021, where the market bounced back into another big rally.\u201d UPDATE (April 10, 2023, 22:27 UTC): Updates with bitcoin's most recent prices.

                  "content": "YouTube, which will offer NFL Sunday Ticket this fall after its three-decade exclusive run on DirecTV came to an end, has revealed initial pricing for the package. In a blog post, YouTube said it will give YouTube TV subscribers a chance to add Sunday Ticket for $249 for the season, a savings of $100. The discount is available through June 6. With the reduction, the price is lower than the roughly $300 charged by DirecTV in recent seasons. YouTube paid more than $2 billion a year for the rights to Sunday Ticket for seven years. It will distribute it both as an add-on to YouTube TV and a stand-alone offering via its Primetime Channels hub, the first time it will be available without a pay-TV subscription. Not surprisingly, the price is significantly higher on an \u00e0 la carte basis. On Primetime Channels, NFL Sunday Ticket is available during the presale at $349 for the season, which is $100 off the regular retail price of $449. Related Story Most Moviegoers Will Still Go To Theaters Even If What They're Seeing Will Soon Be Streaming - Study The move from linear to streaming is a major shift for the package, which was rolled out in the 1990s and quickly became a subscription driver for DirecTV as the satellite operator was on the rise. Today, the NFL is increasingly looking to profit from the live sports appetites of deep-pocketed tech companies, locking an 11-year deal with Amazon Prime Video for Thursday Night Football beginning last season. In addition to the $100 discount for YouTube TV subscribers, a bundle of NFL Sunday Ticket and NFL Redzone \u2014 a popular whip-around show featuring highlights of scoring plays across the league \u2014 will go for $289, also a $100 savings. On Primetime Channels, the Sunday Ticket-Redzone bundle will cost $389 during the presale, compared to the regular price of $489. Christian Oestlien, VP of Product Management, YouTube TV and Connected TV, said features on YouTube TV are being incorporated into Sunday Ticket, including a \u201cmulti-view\u201d option to have multiple games on a single screen. Subscribers will also be able to access highlights of key plays, he said, and additional shopping, fantasy sports and data elements are in the works. YouTube parent Alphabet disclosed last summer that YouTube TV had passed 5 million subscribers, making it one of the top pay-TV providers in the U.S.",

Follow @ jackschickler on Twitter A \"rough year\" for crypto markets has underlined the need for comprehensive and consistent regulation of the sector, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said, suggesting stablecoin issuers and crypto conglomerates need to have bank-style capital requirements. In its \"Global Financial Stability Report\" published Tuesday, the IMF joins the standard setters at the Financial Stability Board in calling for consistent international regulation of the cryptocurrency sector after a year that has seen a number of collapses of major exchanges and crypto-linked banks. \u201cThe collapse of multiple entities in the crypto asset ecosystem has again made the call more urgent for comprehensive and consistent regulation and adequate supervision\u201d focused on protecting consumers and corporate governance, the report said. The report added that regulations should cover crypto storage, transfer, exchange and custody of reserves, with extra prudential requirements for those carrying out multiple functions and for the issuers of stablecoins \u2013 tokens that seek to maintain their value versus fiat currencies. The report cites a \u201crough year for crypto,\u201d in which the collapse of crypto- and tech-heavy lenders Silvergate, Signature and Silicon Valley Banks followed from the bankruptcy of the FTX crypto exchange in November. \u201cThese events add to questions about the viability of digital assets and reinforce the need for appropriate regulation,\u201d the IMF said. The IMF\u2019s report followed a warning issued earlier Tuesday by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) that financial authorities need to be able to monitor crypto leverage, decentralized finance and crypto staking and lending. \"Crypto-assets have experienced exponential growth in recent years, and the future development path of this market is uncertain,\u201d said a statement by the ESRB, a watchdog agency chaired by the European Central Bank\u2019s Christine Lagarde. The Financial Stability Board, a grouping of international regulators, is due to issue its own crypto rules in July, and its head, Klaas Knot, has already said many existing stablecoins would be unlikely to meet its strictures . Many traditional finance players want to see curbs on crypto conglomerates because the mixing of different financial functions could lead to conflicts of interest , despite concerns about constraining innovation. The IMF\u2019s Executive Board has previously expressed concerns over the potential of crypto to usurp the role of legal tender , though it stopped short of calling for an outright ban on digital assets.

Users can send and receive Cardano digital assets like ADA, Cardano non-fungible tokens and Cardano-native tokens. They can also stake ADA directly from the wallet to contribute to the security of the network and receive rewards for their participation, Lace will enable users to send multiple assets to different addresses in one transaction \u2013 with one transaction fee \u2013 through a new \"bundle transaction\" feature, which groups transactions into one bundle to save costs. Developers said they expect to add fiat-to-crypto on-ramps, a dapp store, in-wallet swaps and staking enchantments in future releases. Wallet services such as Lace may allow users to easily access decentralized-finance tools and be incentivized for using services on any blockchain, which may boost the token ecosystem for that network as it attracts traders hunting for opportunities that may have worn off on other networks.

                  "description": "A change to R&D tax rules means that a tech company could lose more than $1 million \u2014 but still be on the hook for hundreds of thousands in taxes.",
                  "content": "The new R&D law has overly broad language that states \u201cany and all\u201d software development must be amortized over five years if the development took place in the United States, or over 15 years if the work was done overseas. The change doesn\u2019t sound so bad on its surface; some argue it might even create more tech jobs in the U.S. But that isn\u2019t how it will play out. Many countries have better R&D credits than the U.S. Much of U.S. software development will shift to countries such as the United Kingdom, where the rules are simple r and more lucrative. For tax-smart companies, U.S. entities will just be for marketing and sales. Imagine a company that lost over a million dollars but owes over $300,000 in taxes! How is this possible? This hypothetical company has roughly $2.5 million in income and, in 2022, spent $1.5 million building its software and $1 million in other costs, meaning it had a negative cashflow totaling $1 million dollars. However, because the $1.5 million of development was done by a team in India, it will only see $50,000 from the software development side, leaving a $1,050,000 deduction to offset the $2.5 million of income this year \u2014 meaning it owes tax on $1,450,000 in net income, or a bankrupting $304,500 in tax! Proponents of this tax say companies will still receive all the benefits of the deduction \u2014 just over many years. Put one of these proponents in front of a company that lost a million on operations but owes $300,000 in taxes and see if they say the same thing. Cashflow is king for finding startup success, and these types of R&D costs have been deducted nearly as long as the United States has had an income tax because of how vitally important innovation is to fueling national growth. With the current climate of high-interest rates and increased regulation, this law change will kill the most creative development in the U.S. on future-thinking technologies, such as AI and blockchain. Some of the Big Tech layoffs taking place may be a result of this rule change. No surprise: It makes more sense to restructure so that subsidiaries outside the U.S. do R&D. For blockchain, crypto, and nonfungible token (NFT) companies that already have to deal with all the Securities and Exchange Commission scrutiny, it just seems a no-brainer to distance from the U.S. now. Related: Get ready for a swarm of incompetent IRS agents in 2023 There are so many complications and unanswered questions of how to apply this law that it\u2019s head-spinning. For example, if you use a computer, server, miner, etc., for your R&D that you are depreciating, that portion of depreciation you would be able to take in 2022 must be added to the capitalization bucket to amortize out. This means if you were using this utility in the U.S. and expected to have $50,000 in depreciation come through from that equipment to deduct this year, you would only see $5,000 of that actually affect the bottom line. This really negates the purpose of special depreciation rules that encourage companies to spend on equipment, but then doesn\u2019t actually let them see the deduction. Another big risk with this law is if you raise money and develop with a big loss and no current income. Initially, this wouldn\u2019t hurt you \u2014 but if your company fails, you are in for a world of pain, because the cancellation of debt income from a SAFE note that was not repaid can trigger taxes if there are no net operating loss carryovers to fully offset. And there is no way, currently, to accelerate the R&D amortization; even if a project is abandoned or a company shuts down, the expenditure cannot be taken immediately. That means equity investors may not get back funds they should receive. Instead, the money in the treasury will go to paying taxes for a failed company while founders who received salaries may even be on the hook for the tax liability or repaying investors. Related: Biden is hiring 87,000 new IRS agents \u2014 and they\u2019re coming for you Everyone in government and the tax industry knew these laws were a mess, and they were set to be repealed by a bipartisan supported bill in Congress on Jan. 3. But the effort failed because Democrats wanted to increase the Child Tax Credit \u2014 at the last minute \u2014 after everything had been agreed, and Republicans wouldn't go along with it. Now, it seems we are stuck with this crazy innovation-killing tax law. A repeal proposal has been reintroduced but hasn\u2019t gained much traction. Especially in light of the current fundraising challenges for blockchain companies caused by increased interest rates, the crypto winter, and the Silicon Valley Bank failure, we may see a massive and unnecessary die-off of tech companies, unless some major action is taken by Congress quickly.

                  "description": "The roots of an hour-long surge were difficult to pinpoint, according to one analyst, but investors have recently been more optimistic about the crypto\u2019s prospects following last month\u2019s banking crisis.",
                  "content": "James Rubin James Rubin is CoinDesk's U.S. news editor based on the West Coast. Follow @ @JPRubin23 on Twitter For a while Monday, even as large parts of the world were off work celebrating Easter Monday, bitcoin (BTC) seemed headed for a promised land above $30,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which just three weeks ago had teased a run toward this threshold, topped $29,744 in the afternoon, its highest level since early June, amid a surge in investor optimism. But the cause of the move was difficult to pinpoint. It was currently trading at $29,616. From about 10 a.m to 11 a.m. ET (14:00-15:00 UTC), bitcoin rose nearly 4%. It had been lingering closer to $28,000 since mid-March, when fears about the conventional banking system began to diminish. \u201cThere isn't a clear catalyst for this spike,\u201d Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk, although he said that the surge might stem partly from \u201cbuying from crypto traders voicing frustration on social media over a one-sided New York Times article that took issue over [bitcoin's] energy consumption.\u201d Moya also noted that the move higher \u201coccurred around the release of news that Federal Home Loan Bank debt issuance had lessened, signaling that \u201cthe banking crisis was easing.\u201d Ether (ETH) also jumped, crossing the $1,900 level before retreating. It was recently up about 1.7% versus 24 hours earlier. Other major cryptos were largely in the green, albeit light shades. ARB, the token of layer 2 blockchain Arbitrum, was recently up more than 2.8%, while XRP rose about 1%. The CoinDesk Market Index , a measure of the crypto market's overall performance, recently rose 2.3%. Equity indexes closed roughly flat with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rising a few ticks of a percentage point, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite losing 0.03%. Crypto-related stocks enjoyed a memorable day with crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and corporate bitcoin vault MicroStrategy (MSTR) both rising more than 7.5%. Markets will be eyeing the March Consumer Price March Index (CPI) report this week for signs that inflation is continuing its recent trudge downward. In February, inflation in the U.S. slowed to 0.4% from 0.5% a month earlier and 6% on a yearly basis from 6.4% the previous month. Bitcoin jumped past $26,000 following that report, on March 14. A continued slowdown could embolden central bankers to scale back their year-long regime of harsh interest rate hikes, although the impact on bitcoin is uncertain. The crypto seemed to gain momentum following the recent U.S. bank failures that caused worries about the conventional financial system, as investors shifted toward assets that retain value through good times and bad. Investors will also be weighing the first wave of quarterly earnings with banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup scheduled to report results. Analysts are expecting a largely downcast quarter, particularly in the hard-hit financial services sector. \u201cBTC is also being seen as a reliable store of value that lacks the issues that come with storing your money by way of a third-party intermediary, or a bank,\u201d Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO and chief legal officer of Banxa , a payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider to the crypto industry, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. \u201cThis is further supported by the decreasing correlation with the equity markets since 2021 \u2013 BTC is now properly starting to be perceived as a risk-off asset.\u201d Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, was cautiously optimistic about the sustainability of bitcoin\u2019s Monday surge. \u201cBitcoin is likely to find resistance at $30,000,\u201d DiPasquale noted in an email to CoinDesk. From a technical-analysis perspective, the current move is \u201ca retest of the range high established in March after the initial surge from under $20,000. Success of this test would see the price claiming $30,000 while a failure here should see BTC drop to $25,000, followed by $23,000.\u201d But he added: \u201cThe current price is also testing the lows of July 2021, where the market bounced back into another big rally.\u201d UPDATE (April 10, 2023, 22:27 UTC): Updates with bitcoin's most recent prices.

                  "content": "YouTube, which will offer NFL Sunday Ticket this fall after its three-decade exclusive run on DirecTV came to an end, has revealed initial pricing for the package. In a blog post, YouTube said it will give YouTube TV subscribers a chance to add Sunday Ticket for $249 for the season, a savings of $100. The discount is available through June 6. With the reduction, the price is lower than the roughly $300 charged by DirecTV in recent seasons. YouTube paid more than $2 billion a year for the rights to Sunday Ticket for seven years. It will distribute it both as an add-on to YouTube TV and a stand-alone offering via its Primetime Channels hub, the first time it will be available without a pay-TV subscription. Not surprisingly, the price is significantly higher on an \u00e0 la carte basis. On Primetime Channels, NFL Sunday Ticket is available during the presale at $349 for the season, which is $100 off the regular retail price of $449. Related Story Most Moviegoers Will Still Go To Theaters Even If What They're Seeing Will Soon Be Streaming - Study The move from linear to streaming is a major shift for the package, which was rolled out in the 1990s and quickly became a subscription driver for DirecTV as the satellite operator was on the rise. Today, the NFL is increasingly looking to profit from the live sports appetites of deep-pocketed tech companies, locking an 11-year deal with Amazon Prime Video for Thursday Night Football beginning last season. In addition to the $100 discount for YouTube TV subscribers, a bundle of NFL Sunday Ticket and NFL Redzone \u2014 a popular whip-around show featuring highlights of scoring plays across the league \u2014 will go for $289, also a $100 savings. On Primetime Channels, the Sunday Ticket-Redzone bundle will cost $389 during the presale, compared to the regular price of $489. Christian Oestlien, VP of Product Management, YouTube TV and Connected TV, said features on YouTube TV are being incorporated into Sunday Ticket, including a \u201cmulti-view\u201d option to have multiple games on a single screen. Subscribers will also be able to access highlights of key plays, he said, and additional shopping, fantasy sports and data elements are in the works. YouTube parent Alphabet disclosed last summer that YouTube TV had passed 5 million subscribers, making it one of the top pay-TV providers in the U.S.",

Follow @ jackschickler on Twitter A \"rough year\" for crypto markets has underlined the need for comprehensive and consistent regulation of the sector, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said, suggesting stablecoin issuers and crypto conglomerates need to have bank-style capital requirements. In its \"Global Financial Stability Report\" published Tuesday, the IMF joins the standard setters at the Financial Stability Board in calling for consistent international regulation of the cryptocurrency sector after a year that has seen a number of collapses of major exchanges and crypto-linked banks. \u201cThe collapse of multiple entities in the crypto asset ecosystem has again made the call more urgent for comprehensive and consistent regulation and adequate supervision\u201d focused on protecting consumers and corporate governance, the report said. The report added that regulations should cover crypto storage, transfer, exchange and custody of reserves, with extra prudential requirements for those carrying out multiple functions and for the issuers of stablecoins \u2013 tokens that seek to maintain their value versus fiat currencies. The report cites a \u201crough year for crypto,\u201d in which the collapse of crypto- and tech-heavy lenders Silvergate, Signature and Silicon Valley Banks followed from the bankruptcy of the FTX crypto exchange in November. \u201cThese events add to questions about the viability of digital assets and reinforce the need for appropriate regulation,\u201d the IMF said. The IMF\u2019s report followed a warning issued earlier Tuesday by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) that financial authorities need to be able to monitor crypto leverage, decentralized finance and crypto staking and lending. \"Crypto-assets have experienced exponential growth in recent years, and the future development path of this market is uncertain,\u201d said a statement by the ESRB, a watchdog agency chaired by the European Central Bank\u2019s Christine Lagarde. The Financial Stability Board, a grouping of international regulators, is due to issue its own crypto rules in July, and its head, Klaas Knot, has already said many existing stablecoins would be unlikely to meet its strictures . Many traditional finance players want to see curbs on crypto conglomerates because the mixing of different financial functions could lead to conflicts of interest , despite concerns about constraining innovation. The IMF\u2019s Executive Board has previously expressed concerns over the potential of crypto to usurp the role of legal tender , though it stopped short of calling for an outright ban on digital assets.

Users can send and receive Cardano digital assets like ADA, Cardano non-fungible tokens and Cardano-native tokens. They can also stake ADA directly from the wallet to contribute to the security of the network and receive rewards for their participation, Lace will enable users to send multiple assets to different addresses in one transaction \u2013 with one transaction fee \u2013 through a new \"bundle transaction\" feature, which groups transactions into one bundle to save costs. Developers said they expect to add fiat-to-crypto on-ramps, a dapp store, in-wallet swaps and staking enchantments in future releases. Wallet services such as Lace may allow users to easily access decentralized-finance tools and be incentivized for using services on any blockchain, which may boost the token ecosystem for that network as it attracts traders hunting for opportunities that may have worn off on other networks.

                  "description": "A change to R&D tax rules means that a tech company could lose more than $1 million \u2014 but still be on the hook for hundreds of thousands in taxes.",
                  "content": "The new R&D law has overly broad language that states \u201cany and all\u201d software development must be amortized over five years if the development took place in the United States, or over 15 years if the work was done overseas. The change doesn\u2019t sound so bad on its surface; some argue it might even create more tech jobs in the U.S. But that isn\u2019t how it will play out. Many countries have better R&D credits than the U.S. Much of U.S. software development will shift to countries such as the United Kingdom, where the rules are simple r and more lucrative. For tax-smart companies, U.S. entities will just be for marketing and sales. Imagine a company that lost over a million dollars but owes over $300,000 in taxes! How is this possible? This hypothetical company has roughly $2.5 million in income and, in 2022, spent $1.5 million building its software and $1 million in other costs, meaning it had a negative cashflow totaling $1 million dollars. However, because the $1.5 million of development was done by a team in India, it will only see $50,000 from the software development side, leaving a $1,050,000 deduction to offset the $2.5 million of income this year \u2014 meaning it owes tax on $1,450,000 in net income, or a bankrupting $304,500 in tax! Proponents of this tax say companies will still receive all the benefits of the deduction \u2014 just over many years. Put one of these proponents in front of a company that lost a million on operations but owes $300,000 in taxes and see if they say the same thing. Cashflow is king for finding startup success, and these types of R&D costs have been deducted nearly as long as the United States has had an income tax because of how vitally important innovation is to fueling national growth. With the current climate of high-interest rates and increased regulation, this law change will kill the most creative development in the U.S. on future-thinking technologies, such as AI and blockchain. Some of the Big Tech layoffs taking place may be a result of this rule change. No surprise: It makes more sense to restructure so that subsidiaries outside the U.S. do R&D. For blockchain, crypto, and nonfungible token (NFT) companies that already have to deal with all the Securities and Exchange Commission scrutiny, it just seems a no-brainer to distance from the U.S. now. Related: Get ready for a swarm of incompetent IRS agents in 2023 There are so many complications and unanswered questions of how to apply this law that it\u2019s head-spinning. For example, if you use a computer, server, miner, etc., for your R&D that you are depreciating, that portion of depreciation you would be able to take in 2022 must be added to the capitalization bucket to amortize out. This means if you were using this utility in the U.S. and expected to have $50,000 in depreciation come through from that equipment to deduct this year, you would only see $5,000 of that actually affect the bottom line. This really negates the purpose of special depreciation rules that encourage companies to spend on equipment, but then doesn\u2019t actually let them see the deduction. Another big risk with this law is if you raise money and develop with a big loss and no current income. Initially, this wouldn\u2019t hurt you \u2014 but if your company fails, you are in for a world of pain, because the cancellation of debt income from a SAFE note that was not repaid can trigger taxes if there are no net operating loss carryovers to fully offset. And there is no way, currently, to accelerate the R&D amortization; even if a project is abandoned or a company shuts down, the expenditure cannot be taken immediately. That means equity investors may not get back funds they should receive. Instead, the money in the treasury will go to paying taxes for a failed company while founders who received salaries may even be on the hook for the tax liability or repaying investors. Related: Biden is hiring 87,000 new IRS agents \u2014 and they\u2019re coming for you Everyone in government and the tax industry knew these laws were a mess, and they were set to be repealed by a bipartisan supported bill in Congress on Jan. 3. But the effort failed because Democrats wanted to increase the Child Tax Credit \u2014 at the last minute \u2014 after everything had been agreed, and Republicans wouldn't go along with it. Now, it seems we are stuck with this crazy innovation-killing tax law. A repeal proposal has been reintroduced but hasn\u2019t gained much traction. Especially in light of the current fundraising challenges for blockchain companies caused by increased interest rates, the crypto winter, and the Silicon Valley Bank failure, we may see a massive and unnecessary die-off of tech companies, unless some major action is taken by Congress quickly.

                  "description": "The roots of an hour-long surge were difficult to pinpoint, according to one analyst, but investors have recently been more optimistic about the crypto\u2019s prospects following last month\u2019s banking crisis.",
                  "content": "James Rubin James Rubin is CoinDesk's U.S. news editor based on the West Coast. Follow @ @JPRubin23 on Twitter For a while Monday, even as large parts of the world were off work celebrating Easter Monday, bitcoin (BTC) seemed headed for a promised land above $30,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which just three weeks ago had teased a run toward this threshold, topped $29,744 in the afternoon, its highest level since early June, amid a surge in investor optimism. But the cause of the move was difficult to pinpoint. It was currently trading at $29,616. From about 10 a.m to 11 a.m. ET (14:00-15:00 UTC), bitcoin rose nearly 4%. It had been lingering closer to $28,000 since mid-March, when fears about the conventional banking system began to diminish. \u201cThere isn't a clear catalyst for this spike,\u201d Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk, although he said that the surge might stem partly from \u201cbuying from crypto traders voicing frustration on social media over a one-sided New York Times article that took issue over [bitcoin's] energy consumption.\u201d Moya also noted that the move higher \u201coccurred around the release of news that Federal Home Loan Bank debt issuance had lessened, signaling that \u201cthe banking crisis was easing.\u201d Ether (ETH) also jumped, crossing the $1,900 level before retreating. It was recently up about 1.7% versus 24 hours earlier. Other major cryptos were largely in the green, albeit light shades. ARB, the token of layer 2 blockchain Arbitrum, was recently up more than 2.8%, while XRP rose about 1%. The CoinDesk Market Index , a measure of the crypto market's overall performance, recently rose 2.3%. Equity indexes closed roughly flat with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rising a few ticks of a percentage point, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite losing 0.03%. Crypto-related stocks enjoyed a memorable day with crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and corporate bitcoin vault MicroStrategy (MSTR) both rising more than 7.5%. Markets will be eyeing the March Consumer Price March Index (CPI) report this week for signs that inflation is continuing its recent trudge downward. In February, inflation in the U.S. slowed to 0.4% from 0.5% a month earlier and 6% on a yearly basis from 6.4% the previous month. Bitcoin jumped past $26,000 following that report, on March 14. A continued slowdown could embolden central bankers to scale back their year-long regime of harsh interest rate hikes, although the impact on bitcoin is uncertain. The crypto seemed to gain momentum following the recent U.S. bank failures that caused worries about the conventional financial system, as investors shifted toward assets that retain value through good times and bad. Investors will also be weighing the first wave of quarterly earnings with banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup scheduled to report results. Analysts are expecting a largely downcast quarter, particularly in the hard-hit financial services sector. \u201cBTC is also being seen as a reliable store of value that lacks the issues that come with storing your money by way of a third-party intermediary, or a bank,\u201d Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO and chief legal officer of Banxa , a payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider to the crypto industry, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. \u201cThis is further supported by the decreasing correlation with the equity markets since 2021 \u2013 BTC is now properly starting to be perceived as a risk-off asset.\u201d Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, was cautiously optimistic about the sustainability of bitcoin\u2019s Monday surge. \u201cBitcoin is likely to find resistance at $30,000,\u201d DiPasquale noted in an email to CoinDesk. From a technical-analysis perspective, the current move is \u201ca retest of the range high established in March after the initial surge from under $20,000. Success of this test would see the price claiming $30,000 while a failure here should see BTC drop to $25,000, followed by $23,000.\u201d But he added: \u201cThe current price is also testing the lows of July 2021, where the market bounced back into another big rally.\u201d UPDATE (April 10, 2023, 22:27 UTC): Updates with bitcoin's most recent prices.

                  "content": "YouTube, which will offer NFL Sunday Ticket this fall after its three-decade exclusive run on DirecTV came to an end, has revealed initial pricing for the package. In a blog post, YouTube said it will give YouTube TV subscribers a chance to add Sunday Ticket for $249 for the season, a savings of $100. The discount is available through June 6. With the reduction, the price is lower than the roughly $300 charged by DirecTV in recent seasons. YouTube paid more than $2 billion a year for the rights to Sunday Ticket for seven years. It will distribute it both as an add-on to YouTube TV and a stand-alone offering via its Primetime Channels hub, the first time it will be available without a pay-TV subscription. Not surprisingly, the price is significantly higher on an \u00e0 la carte basis. On Primetime Channels, NFL Sunday Ticket is available during the presale at $349 for the season, which is $100 off the regular retail price of $449. Related Story Most Moviegoers Will Still Go To Theaters Even If What They're Seeing Will Soon Be Streaming - Study The move from linear to streaming is a major shift for the package, which was rolled out in the 1990s and quickly became a subscription driver for DirecTV as the satellite operator was on the rise. Today, the NFL is increasingly looking to profit from the live sports appetites of deep-pocketed tech companies, locking an 11-year deal with Amazon Prime Video for Thursday Night Football beginning last season. In addition to the $100 discount for YouTube TV subscribers, a bundle of NFL Sunday Ticket and NFL Redzone \u2014 a popular whip-around show featuring highlights of scoring plays across the league \u2014 will go for $289, also a $100 savings. On Primetime Channels, the Sunday Ticket-Redzone bundle will cost $389 during the presale, compared to the regular price of $489. Christian Oestlien, VP of Product Management, YouTube TV and Connected TV, said features on YouTube TV are being incorporated into Sunday Ticket, including a \u201cmulti-view\u201d option to have multiple games on a single screen. Subscribers will also be able to access highlights of key plays, he said, and additional shopping, fantasy sports and data elements are in the works. YouTube parent Alphabet disclosed last summer that YouTube TV had passed 5 million subscribers, making it one of the top pay-TV providers in the U.S.",

Follow @ jackschickler on Twitter A \"rough year\" for crypto markets has underlined the need for comprehensive and consistent regulation of the sector, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said, suggesting stablecoin issuers and crypto conglomerates need to have bank-style capital requirements. In its \"Global Financial Stability Report\" published Tuesday, the IMF joins the standard setters at the Financial Stability Board in calling for consistent international regulation of the cryptocurrency sector after a year that has seen a number of collapses of major exchanges and crypto-linked banks. \u201cThe collapse of multiple entities in the crypto asset ecosystem has again made the call more urgent for comprehensive and consistent regulation and adequate supervision\u201d focused on protecting consumers and corporate governance, the report said. The report added that regulations should cover crypto storage, transfer, exchange and custody of reserves, with extra prudential requirements for those carrying out multiple functions and for the issuers of stablecoins \u2013 tokens that seek to maintain their value versus fiat currencies. The report cites a \u201crough year for crypto,\u201d in which the collapse of crypto- and tech-heavy lenders Silvergate, Signature and Silicon Valley Banks followed from the bankruptcy of the FTX crypto exchange in November. \u201cThese events add to questions about the viability of digital assets and reinforce the need for appropriate regulation,\u201d the IMF said. The IMF\u2019s report followed a warning issued earlier Tuesday by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) that financial authorities need to be able to monitor crypto leverage, decentralized finance and crypto staking and lending. \"Crypto-assets have experienced exponential growth in recent years, and the future development path of this market is uncertain,\u201d said a statement by the ESRB, a watchdog agency chaired by the European Central Bank\u2019s Christine Lagarde. The Financial Stability Board, a grouping of international regulators, is due to issue its own crypto rules in July, and its head, Klaas Knot, has already said many existing stablecoins would be unlikely to meet its strictures . Many traditional finance players want to see curbs on crypto conglomerates because the mixing of different financial functions could lead to conflicts of interest , despite concerns about constraining innovation. The IMF\u2019s Executive Board has previously expressed concerns over the potential of crypto to usurp the role of legal tender , though it stopped short of calling for an outright ban on digital assets.

Lace is a browser-based wallet similar to the popular MetaMask product. It allows users to access the Cardano network directly and use Cardano-based decentralized applications . Users can send and receive Cardano digital assets like ADA, Cardano non-fungible tokens and Cardano-native tokens. They can also stake ADA directly from the wallet to contribute to the security of the network and receive rewards for their participation, Lace will enable users to send multiple assets to different addresses in one transaction \u2013 with one transaction fee \u2013 through a new \"bundle transaction\" feature, which groups transactions into one bundle to save costs. Developers said they expect to add fiat-to-crypto on-ramps, a dapp store, in-wallet swaps and staking enchantments in future releases. Wallet services such as Lace may allow users to easily access decentralized-finance tools and be incentivized for using services on any blockchain, which may boost the token ecosystem for that network as it attracts traders hunting for opportunities that may have worn off on other networks.

                  "description": "A change to R&D tax rules means that a tech company could lose more than $1 million \u2014 but still be on the hook for hundreds of thousands in taxes.",
                  "content": "The new R&D law has overly broad language that states \u201cany and all\u201d software development must be amortized over five years if the development took place in the United States, or over 15 years if the work was done overseas. The change doesn\u2019t sound so bad on its surface; some argue it might even create more tech jobs in the U.S. But that isn\u2019t how it will play out. Many countries have better R&D credits than the U.S. Much of U.S. software development will shift to countries such as the United Kingdom, where the rules are simple r and more lucrative. For tax-smart companies, U.S. entities will just be for marketing and sales. Imagine a company that lost over a million dollars but owes over $300,000 in taxes! How is this possible? This hypothetical company has roughly $2.5 million in income and, in 2022, spent $1.5 million building its software and $1 million in other costs, meaning it had a negative cashflow totaling $1 million dollars. However, because the $1.5 million of development was done by a team in India, it will only see $50,000 from the software development side, leaving a $1,050,000 deduction to offset the $2.5 million of income this year \u2014 meaning it owes tax on $1,450,000 in net income, or a bankrupting $304,500 in tax! Proponents of this tax say companies will still receive all the benefits of the deduction \u2014 just over many years. Put one of these proponents in front of a company that lost a million on operations but owes $300,000 in taxes and see if they say the same thing. Cashflow is king for finding startup success, and these types of R&D costs have been deducted nearly as long as the United States has had an income tax because of how vitally important innovation is to fueling national growth. With the current climate of high-interest rates and increased regulation, this law change will kill the most creative development in the U.S. on future-thinking technologies, such as AI and blockchain. Some of the Big Tech layoffs taking place may be a result of this rule change. No surprise: It makes more sense to restructure so that subsidiaries outside the U.S. do R&D. For blockchain, crypto, and nonfungible token (NFT) companies that already have to deal with all the Securities and Exchange Commission scrutiny, it just seems a no-brainer to distance from the U.S. now. Related: Get ready for a swarm of incompetent IRS agents in 2023 There are so many complications and unanswered questions of how to apply this law that it\u2019s head-spinning. For example, if you use a computer, server, miner, etc., for your R&D that you are depreciating, that portion of depreciation you would be able to take in 2022 must be added to the capitalization bucket to amortize out. This means if you were using this utility in the U.S. and expected to have $50,000 in depreciation come through from that equipment to deduct this year, you would only see $5,000 of that actually affect the bottom line. This really negates the purpose of special depreciation rules that encourage companies to spend on equipment, but then doesn\u2019t actually let them see the deduction. Another big risk with this law is if you raise money and develop with a big loss and no current income. Initially, this wouldn\u2019t hurt you \u2014 but if your company fails, you are in for a world of pain, because the cancellation of debt income from a SAFE note that was not repaid can trigger taxes if there are no net operating loss carryovers to fully offset. And there is no way, currently, to accelerate the R&D amortization; even if a project is abandoned or a company shuts down, the expenditure cannot be taken immediately. That means equity investors may not get back funds they should receive. Instead, the money in the treasury will go to paying taxes for a failed company while founders who received salaries may even be on the hook for the tax liability or repaying investors. Related: Biden is hiring 87,000 new IRS agents \u2014 and they\u2019re coming for you Everyone in government and the tax industry knew these laws were a mess, and they were set to be repealed by a bipartisan supported bill in Congress on Jan. 3. But the effort failed because Democrats wanted to increase the Child Tax Credit \u2014 at the last minute \u2014 after everything had been agreed, and Republicans wouldn't go along with it. Now, it seems we are stuck with this crazy innovation-killing tax law. A repeal proposal has been reintroduced but hasn\u2019t gained much traction. Especially in light of the current fundraising challenges for blockchain companies caused by increased interest rates, the crypto winter, and the Silicon Valley Bank failure, we may see a massive and unnecessary die-off of tech companies, unless some major action is taken by Congress quickly.

                  "description": "The roots of an hour-long surge were difficult to pinpoint, according to one analyst, but investors have recently been more optimistic about the crypto\u2019s prospects following last month\u2019s banking crisis.",
                  "content": "James Rubin James Rubin is CoinDesk's U.S. news editor based on the West Coast. Follow @ @JPRubin23 on Twitter For a while Monday, even as large parts of the world were off work celebrating Easter Monday, bitcoin (BTC) seemed headed for a promised land above $30,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which just three weeks ago had teased a run toward this threshold, topped $29,744 in the afternoon, its highest level since early June, amid a surge in investor optimism. But the cause of the move was difficult to pinpoint. It was currently trading at $29,616. From about 10 a.m to 11 a.m. ET (14:00-15:00 UTC), bitcoin rose nearly 4%. It had been lingering closer to $28,000 since mid-March, when fears about the conventional banking system began to diminish. \u201cThere isn't a clear catalyst for this spike,\u201d Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk, although he said that the surge might stem partly from \u201cbuying from crypto traders voicing frustration on social media over a one-sided New York Times article that took issue over [bitcoin's] energy consumption.\u201d Moya also noted that the move higher \u201coccurred around the release of news that Federal Home Loan Bank debt issuance had lessened, signaling that \u201cthe banking crisis was easing.\u201d Ether (ETH) also jumped, crossing the $1,900 level before retreating. It was recently up about 1.7% versus 24 hours earlier. Other major cryptos were largely in the green, albeit light shades. ARB, the token of layer 2 blockchain Arbitrum, was recently up more than 2.8%, while XRP rose about 1%. The CoinDesk Market Index , a measure of the crypto market's overall performance, recently rose 2.3%. Equity indexes closed roughly flat with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rising a few ticks of a percentage point, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite losing 0.03%. Crypto-related stocks enjoyed a memorable day with crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and corporate bitcoin vault MicroStrategy (MSTR) both rising more than 7.5%. Markets will be eyeing the March Consumer Price March Index (CPI) report this week for signs that inflation is continuing its recent trudge downward. In February, inflation in the U.S. slowed to 0.4% from 0.5% a month earlier and 6% on a yearly basis from 6.4% the previous month. Bitcoin jumped past $26,000 following that report, on March 14. A continued slowdown could embolden central bankers to scale back their year-long regime of harsh interest rate hikes, although the impact on bitcoin is uncertain. The crypto seemed to gain momentum following the recent U.S. bank failures that caused worries about the conventional financial system, as investors shifted toward assets that retain value through good times and bad. Investors will also be weighing the first wave of quarterly earnings with banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup scheduled to report results. Analysts are expecting a largely downcast quarter, particularly in the hard-hit financial services sector. \u201cBTC is also being seen as a reliable store of value that lacks the issues that come with storing your money by way of a third-party intermediary, or a bank,\u201d Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO and chief legal officer of Banxa , a payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider to the crypto industry, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. \u201cThis is further supported by the decreasing correlation with the equity markets since 2021 \u2013 BTC is now properly starting to be perceived as a risk-off asset.\u201d Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, was cautiously optimistic about the sustainability of bitcoin\u2019s Monday surge. \u201cBitcoin is likely to find resistance at $30,000,\u201d DiPasquale noted in an email to CoinDesk. From a technical-analysis perspective, the current move is \u201ca retest of the range high established in March after the initial surge from under $20,000. Success of this test would see the price claiming $30,000 while a failure here should see BTC drop to $25,000, followed by $23,000.\u201d But he added: \u201cThe current price is also testing the lows of July 2021, where the market bounced back into another big rally.\u201d UPDATE (April 10, 2023, 22:27 UTC): Updates with bitcoin's most recent prices.

                  "content": "YouTube, which will offer NFL Sunday Ticket this fall after its three-decade exclusive run on DirecTV came to an end, has revealed initial pricing for the package. In a blog post, YouTube said it will give YouTube TV subscribers a chance to add Sunday Ticket for $249 for the season, a savings of $100. The discount is available through June 6. With the reduction, the price is lower than the roughly $300 charged by DirecTV in recent seasons. YouTube paid more than $2 billion a year for the rights to Sunday Ticket for seven years. It will distribute it both as an add-on to YouTube TV and a stand-alone offering via its Primetime Channels hub, the first time it will be available without a pay-TV subscription. Not surprisingly, the price is significantly higher on an \u00e0 la carte basis. On Primetime Channels, NFL Sunday Ticket is available during the presale at $349 for the season, which is $100 off the regular retail price of $449. Related Story Most Moviegoers Will Still Go To Theaters Even If What They're Seeing Will Soon Be Streaming - Study The move from linear to streaming is a major shift for the package, which was rolled out in the 1990s and quickly became a subscription driver for DirecTV as the satellite operator was on the rise. Today, the NFL is increasingly looking to profit from the live sports appetites of deep-pocketed tech companies, locking an 11-year deal with Amazon Prime Video for Thursday Night Football beginning last season. In addition to the $100 discount for YouTube TV subscribers, a bundle of NFL Sunday Ticket and NFL Redzone \u2014 a popular whip-around show featuring highlights of scoring plays across the league \u2014 will go for $289, also a $100 savings. On Primetime Channels, the Sunday Ticket-Redzone bundle will cost $389 during the presale, compared to the regular price of $489. Christian Oestlien, VP of Product Management, YouTube TV and Connected TV, said features on YouTube TV are being incorporated into Sunday Ticket, including a \u201cmulti-view\u201d option to have multiple games on a single screen. Subscribers will also be able to access highlights of key plays, he said, and additional shopping, fantasy sports and data elements are in the works.

Follow @ jackschickler on Twitter A \"rough year\" for crypto markets has underlined the need for comprehensive and consistent regulation of the sector, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said, suggesting stablecoin issuers and crypto conglomerates need to have bank-style capital requirements. In its \"Global Financial Stability Report\" published Tuesday, the IMF joins the standard setters at the Financial Stability Board in calling for consistent international regulation of the cryptocurrency sector after a year that has seen a number of collapses of major exchanges and crypto-linked banks. \u201cThe collapse of multiple entities in the crypto asset ecosystem has again made the call more urgent for comprehensive and consistent regulation and adequate supervision\u201d focused on protecting consumers and corporate governance, the report said. The report added that regulations should cover crypto storage, transfer, exchange and custody of reserves, with extra prudential requirements for those carrying out multiple functions and for the issuers of stablecoins \u2013 tokens that seek to maintain their value versus fiat currencies. The report cites a \u201crough year for crypto,\u201d in which the collapse of crypto- and tech-heavy lenders Silvergate, Signature and Silicon Valley Banks followed from the bankruptcy of the FTX crypto exchange in November. \u201cThese events add to questions about the viability of digital assets and reinforce the need for appropriate regulation,\u201d the IMF said. The IMF\u2019s report followed a warning issued earlier Tuesday by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) that financial authorities need to be able to monitor crypto leverage, decentralized finance and crypto staking and lending. \"Crypto-assets have experienced exponential growth in recent years, and the future development path of this market is uncertain,\u201d said a statement by the ESRB, a watchdog agency chaired by the European Central Bank\u2019s Christine Lagarde. The Financial Stability Board, a grouping of international regulators, is due to issue its own crypto rules in July, and its head, Klaas Knot, has already said many existing stablecoins would be unlikely to meet its strictures . Many traditional finance players want to see curbs on crypto conglomerates because the mixing of different financial functions could lead to conflicts of interest , despite concerns about constraining innovation. The IMF\u2019s Executive Board has previously expressed concerns over the potential of crypto to usurp the role of legal tender , though it stopped short of calling for an outright ban on digital assets.

                  "description": "Polygon Miden founder Bobbin Threadbare reveals exclusive details about Polygon\u2019s most innovative ZK-rollup yet.",
                  "content": "ZK-rollups are the hottest thing in Ethereum right now, having seemingly appeared out of nowhere in late 2018 to fundamentally reshape the \u201cEth2\u201d plan to scale via sharding alone. Zero-knowledge, or validity proof rollups, essentially perform the computations for many thousands of transactions away from Ethereum and then write a tiny cryptographic proof back to the blockchain that verifies those transactions were performed correctly. It\u2019s much faster and cheaper than using the base layer and has the potential for virtually unlimited scaling . To an outsider, it looked like the technology went from 0 to 100 in a couple of years , but from the perspective of Polygon Miden founder Bobbin Threadbare, it doesn\u2019t seem fast enough. \u201cYour internal perception is that it\u2019s moving slowly,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople say, \u2018We\u2019re going to be doing this in a year,\u2019 and it takes longer because people overestimate [how quickly it can be done].\u201d \u201cBut if you take a step back out of your own bubble, I do think that the tech is moving at an amazing pace. A lot of the things we\u2019re doing now did not exist 10 years ago \u2014 or even maybe like eight years ago \u2014 they were just theoretical concepts.\u201d Magazine catches up with Threadbare at the StarkWare Sessions in Israel. Since Polygon Miden is a competing ZK-rollup solution to StarkWare\u2019s tech, this is a little like interviewing the CEO of Pepsi at a Coca-Cola convention. But it turns out zero-knowledge proofs are not as cutthroat as sodas. \u201cOn the technical side, there is a lot of collaboration,\u201d Threadbare explains. \u201cIf you follow Twitter, you may get an impression that people are at each other\u2019s throats all the time, but you know, it\u2019s Twitter more than anything.\u201d He points out that all of the projects are building open-source technology (or plan to make it open-source). \u201cWe\u2019re not building like Web2 walled gardens here,\u201d he says, adding that various projects \u201cdon\u2019t necessarily perceive other rollups as their technical competitors; we learn from each other more.\u201d Polygon\u2019s MATIC became the eighth-most valuable cryptocurrency in the world thanks to its current Ethereum scaling solution, but Polygon\u2019s founders knew ZK-rollups could potentially render the network obsolete and spent some of their massive war chest on a ZK tech acquisition and hiring spree. The Polygon team\u2019s approach is essentially to throw a lot of stuff at the wall and see what sticks. Their zkEVM project has just launched on mainnet in beta , and it enables any Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible project to scale on its new network. Other ZK flavors at Polygon include Zero (recursive scaling), Hermez 2.0 (an EVM-compatible solution focused on decentralization and a proof-of-efficiency consensus) and Nightfall (Optimistic Rollups meet zero-knowledge cryptography). Threadbare, who was working for Facebook at the time, was headhunted to develop his open-source ZK technology into Miden. \u201cThis strategy made sense to me; the space is very early,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, in all honesty, they didn\u2019t even require that I use STARKs, or SNARKs, or anything.\u201d STARKs (zero-knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge) and SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) are the two different types of ZK proof systems. \u201cThey were very open to whatever technology because nobody had the answer. Hopefully, now we have more of an answer than we did like a year or two years ago.\u201d Polygon Miden is essentially the Polygon version of StarkNet. It enables a bunch of transactions to be processed off the main blockchain, and then \u201cvalidity proof\u201d demonstrating the transactions are computed correctly, to be written back as a single transaction on Ethereum. STARKs have some advantages over SNARKs in that less trust is required for the setup, and they\u2019ll be resistant to quantum computer attacks. However, STARKs have much, much larger validity proof sizes, which is more expensive to write back to Ethereum. In another similarity to StarkNet , which uses the Cairo programming language and virtual machine instead of Solidity and EVM, Miden uses its own virtual machine. For both projects, this is a gamble, as it makes it more difficult for Ethereum projects to port over to the rollup. On the other hand, it means Polygon Miden can scale faster and further by enabling it to escape Ethereum\u2019s constraints. \u201cWithin Polygon, we do think about How do we expand Ethereum? , and there are multiple dimensions,\u201d Threadbare says. \u201cSo, scaling is one dimension but also features and other things that are not easy to do on Ethereum, such as privacy and parallel processing, would be another dimension, and this is where Miden comes in.\u201d Magazine later asks StarkNet co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson for his assessment of his competitor, whom he\u2019s known since the first StarkWare Sessions four years earlier. \u201cI think Miden is amazing,\u201d says Ben-Sasson. \u201cI have a lot of respect for all of those working within the framework of general validity proofs.\u201d \u201cHaving said that, and with all due respect, I do think that, as far as VMs and feature-laden compute frameworks go, I think that Cairo is better. And I\u2019ve said so to Bobbin.\u201d Threadbare isn\u2019t a cryptographer; he\u2019s a hands-on builder and says the instant he learned about ZK-rollups, he knew it would be the answer to blockchain scaling because it removes one of technology\u2019s greatest inefficiencies \u2014 requiring everyone on the network to process each transaction. \u201cOnce I learned about ZK tech, it became almost obvious that this is going to be the end game. Because in the blockchain, basically, you have the same computation that everybody has to reexecute. And this is so wasteful. When you see this technology where you only have to execute once and everybody can verify your computation exponentially faster, that\u2019s almost like an obvious thing that needs to be done.\u201d With Polygon Miden, anyone will be able to run a smart contract locally and just send the proof to the network, which enables transactions to be run in parallel, rather than sequentially. If Polygon Miden had stuck with the EVM, that would be very difficult, and that limits throughput. With Ethereum currently processing a dozen or so transactions a second, that\u2019s not a problem, but when TPS ticks over into the thousands, it will be. \u201cYou need to be able to process transactions in parallel because, in a single thread, there\u2019s only so much you can do,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can go much more than a few thousand TPS without parallelizing things.\u201d \u201cBeing able to execute transactions locally means you can run arbitrarily complex computation, and it places almost no burden on the network,\u201d he explains, pointing out that running a 3D physics engine is impossible on Ethereum right now, but will become possible with Polygon Miden. \u201cThe design space opens up,\u201d he says. \u201cThat enables a bunch of new use cases, but it also helps with privacy if I don\u2019t have to actually reveal the computation.\u201d Like zkSync Era and StarkNet, the plan is to launch with a centralized prover and then gradually decentralize. Eventually, all of Polygon\u2019s ZK solutions will become interoperable, with MATIC remaining the key token. However, native account abstraction means users could pay with other major tokens, too. Threadbare (not his real name) was born in the Republic of Georgia in the dying days of the USSR in the 1980s. He moved to the United States when he was 17 to study computer science in San Diego, later attending business school at the University of Chicago. He was a consultant for five years before he launched a Web2 startup that calculated user trustworthiness and reputation scores for things like P2P transactions. He started exploring blockchain in 2018 as a way to avoid having to store a large database of user information. \u201cSelf-sovereign identity is one of the things that was very interesting to me,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then I got very deep into the technical aspects and then came across zero-knowledge proofs. Once I understood what they can do, the identity use case wasn\u2019t all that interesting anymore. I thought there are much bigger and more interesting things you can do with them.\u201d He stumbled across a blog about STARKs by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin , and that set him off down the rabbit hole. \u201cHe actually had a code written that demonstrates a very basic proof-of-concept of how it works \u2014 and that was, for me, very, very useful.\u201d Threadbare took the code and rewrote it in another language so he could understand how it worked from the inside out. A born tinkerer, he started improving aspects to make them more general. Before long, he\u2019d built a basic general-purpose prover for STARKs and posted it on Eth Research. \u201cA lot of people were interested in zero-knowledge proofs at that time, but there were not a lot of tools, especially around STARKs. And I just got lucky in the thing that I picked to learn and build on because it fascinated a bunch of people.\u201d \u201cEven Vitalik himself basically sent me a message on Eth Research, saying, \u2018Hey, who are you? What are you doing?\u2019\u201d It was Buterin who introduced him to StarkWare, and they invited him along to the first StarkWare Sessions four years ago. Threadbare started creating ZK tools and libraries. He developed the AirScript and AirAssembly domain-specific languages, which in turn led him to develop the Distaff Virtual Machine in early 2020 so people could code without having to learn those new languages. But as the pandemic started, he took up a job as a core ZK researcher for Facebook, working on the Libra cryptocurrency project. Part of the appeal was working alongside and learning from \u201creal\u201d cryptographers, and he helped build the open-source Winterfell STARK prover and verifier. Facebook didn\u2019t actually need one or plan to use it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that it was just for the hell of it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe thought was it was going to be used at some point in time. But it was probably fairly clear this is not going to be used in the next two to three or maybe even five years time frame.\u201d Ultimately, regulators did not approve of the social media giant launching a private currency, and Libra transformed into Diem and then quietly disappeared. Around the same time in 2021, Polygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic was assembling his crack team of ZK developers and remembered the shadowy anon who\u2019d posted a bunch of useful ZK tech like Distaff on Eth Research. So, he got in touch, totally unaware Threadbare was working at Facebook. For his part, Threadbare was totally unaware Polygon even existed but started holding regular calls every couple of weeks with Bjelic to talk about their scaling plans and sketch out a possible collaboration. They discussed building a ZK EVM, but Threadbare was keen to use his own virtual machine and combine STARKs with the power of recursion. That\u2019s where you take a bunch of validity proofs, each representing a bundle of transactions, and produce one validity proof that proves all other validity proofs were done correctly. Suddenly, the fact the STARK-proof size is 50\u2013100 times bigger than a SNARK-proof size was a lot less important. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I went the virtual machine route because if you have the VM, it\u2019s much easier to have this infinite recursion because if you think about it, when you have a virtual machine that is Turing-complete, it basically it can execute any program.\u201d \u201cYou just write a program that verifies itself, and you kind of have infinite recursion at this point in time. And that was appealing to me.\u201d This talk of infinite recursion recalls Declan Fox, product manager for rollups at ConsenSys, who told Magazine last year that ZK-rollups and recursion meant it was \u201ctheoretically possible\u201d for the entire world\u2019s financial system to run on Ethereum. Infinite scaling is unfortunately still limited by data availability on Ethereum \u2014 which refers to how much data needs to be, and can be, written back to the chain. The new rollup-focused roadmap will increase the amount of data each block can carry by 160 times. Even that probably won\u2019t be enough. \u201cThere are still limitations like nothing is infinite,\u201d he says. \u201cAssuming the blockchain and the crypto space succeeds\u2026 the demand for TPS will be hundreds of thousands or maybe millions of TPS eventually, so I don\u2019t know if the base layer will always be able to provide this much data availability.\u201d But he\u2019s very hopeful we\u2019ll see a huge amount of adoption within the next 10 years. \u201cHopefully, if we are successful, Ethereum will be the most secure base layer, and there will be a thriving rollup ecosystem that caters to different things, and hopefully, Polygon will be a big part of that ecosystem.\u201d",

                  "description": "A change to R&D tax rules means that a tech company could lose more than $1 million \u2014 but still be on the hook for hundreds of thousands in taxes.",
                  "content": "The new R&D law has overly broad language that states \u201cany and all\u201d software development must be amortized over five years if the development took place in the United States, or over 15 years if the work was done overseas. The change doesn\u2019t sound so bad on its surface; some argue it might even create more tech jobs in the U.S. But that isn\u2019t how it will play out. Many countries have better R&D credits than the U.S. Much of U.S. software development will shift to countries such as the United Kingdom, where the rules are simple r and more lucrative. For tax-smart companies, U.S. entities will just be for marketing and sales. Imagine a company that lost over a million dollars but owes over $300,000 in taxes! How is this possible? This hypothetical company has roughly $2.5 million in income and, in 2022, spent $1.5 million building its software and $1 million in other costs, meaning it had a negative cashflow totaling $1 million dollars. However, because the $1.5 million of development was done by a team in India, it will only see $50,000 from the software development side, leaving a $1,050,000 deduction to offset the $2.5 million of income this year \u2014 meaning it owes tax on $1,450,000 in net income, or a bankrupting $304,500 in tax! Proponents of this tax say companies will still receive all the benefits of the deduction \u2014 just over many years. Put one of these proponents in front of a company that lost a million on operations but owes $300,000 in taxes and see if they say the same thing. Cashflow is king for finding startup success, and these types of R&D costs have been deducted nearly as long as the United States has had an income tax because of how vitally important innovation is to fueling national growth. With the current climate of high-interest rates and increased regulation, this law change will kill the most creative development in the U.S. on future-thinking technologies, such as AI and blockchain. Some of the Big Tech layoffs taking place may be a result of this rule change. No surprise: It makes more sense to restructure so that subsidiaries outside the U.S. do R&D. For blockchain, crypto, and nonfungible token (NFT) companies that already have to deal with all the Securities and Exchange Commission scrutiny, it just seems a no-brainer to distance from the U.S. now. Related: Get ready for a swarm of incompetent IRS agents in 2023 There are so many complications and unanswered questions of how to apply this law that it\u2019s head-spinning. For example, if you use a computer, server, miner, etc., for your R&D that you are depreciating, that portion of depreciation you would be able to take in 2022 must be added to the capitalization bucket to amortize out. This means if you were using this utility in the U.S. and expected to have $50,000 in depreciation come through from that equipment to deduct this year, you would only see $5,000 of that actually affect the bottom line. This really negates the purpose of special depreciation rules that encourage companies to spend on equipment, but then doesn\u2019t actually let them see the deduction. Another big risk with this law is if you raise money and develop with a big loss and no current income. Initially, this wouldn\u2019t hurt you \u2014 but if your company fails, you are in for a world of pain, because the cancellation of debt income from a SAFE note that was not repaid can trigger taxes if there are no net operating loss carryovers to fully offset. And there is no way, currently, to accelerate the R&D amortization; even if a project is abandoned or a company shuts down, the expenditure cannot be taken immediately. That means equity investors may not get back funds they should receive. Instead, the money in the treasury will go to paying taxes for a failed company while founders who received salaries may even be on the hook for the tax liability or repaying investors. Related: Biden is hiring 87,000 new IRS agents \u2014 and they\u2019re coming for you Everyone in government and the tax industry knew these laws were a mess, and they were set to be repealed by a bipartisan supported bill in Congress on Jan. 3. But the effort failed because Democrats wanted to increase the Child Tax Credit \u2014 at the last minute \u2014 after everything had been agreed, and Republicans wouldn't go along with it. Now, it seems we are stuck with this crazy innovation-killing tax law. A repeal proposal has been reintroduced but hasn\u2019t gained much traction. Especially in light of the current fundraising challenges for blockchain companies caused by increased interest rates, the crypto winter, and the Silicon Valley Bank failure, we may see a massive and unnecessary die-off of tech companies, unless some major action is taken by Congress quickly.

                  "description": "The roots of an hour-long surge were difficult to pinpoint, according to one analyst, but investors have recently been more optimistic about the crypto\u2019s prospects following last month\u2019s banking crisis.",
                  "content": "James Rubin James Rubin is CoinDesk's U.S. news editor based on the West Coast. Follow @ @JPRubin23 on Twitter For a while Monday, even as large parts of the world were off work celebrating Easter Monday, bitcoin (BTC) seemed headed for a promised land above $30,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which just three weeks ago had teased a run toward this threshold, topped $29,744 in the afternoon, its highest level since early June, amid a surge in investor optimism. But the cause of the move was difficult to pinpoint. It was currently trading at $29,616. From about 10 a.m to 11 a.m. ET (14:00-15:00 UTC), bitcoin rose nearly 4%. It had been lingering closer to $28,000 since mid-March, when fears about the conventional banking system began to diminish. \u201cThere isn't a clear catalyst for this spike,\u201d Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk, although he said that the surge might stem partly from \u201cbuying from crypto traders voicing frustration on social media over a one-sided New York Times article that took issue over [bitcoin's] energy consumption.\u201d Moya also noted that the move higher \u201coccurred around the release of news that Federal Home Loan Bank debt issuance had lessened, signaling that \u201cthe banking crisis was easing.\u201d Ether (ETH) also jumped, crossing the $1,900 level before retreating. It was recently up about 1.7% versus 24 hours earlier. Other major cryptos were largely in the green, albeit light shades. ARB, the token of layer 2 blockchain Arbitrum, was recently up more than 2.8%, while XRP rose about 1%. The CoinDesk Market Index , a measure of the crypto market's overall performance, recently rose 2.3%. Equity indexes closed roughly flat with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rising a few ticks of a percentage point, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite losing 0.03%. Crypto-related stocks enjoyed a memorable day with crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and corporate bitcoin vault MicroStrategy (MSTR) both rising more than 7.5%. Markets will be eyeing the March Consumer Price March Index (CPI) report this week for signs that inflation is continuing its recent trudge downward. In February, inflation in the U.S. slowed to 0.4% from 0.5% a month earlier and 6% on a yearly basis from 6.4% the previous month. Bitcoin jumped past $26,000 following that report, on March 14. A continued slowdown could embolden central bankers to scale back their year-long regime of harsh interest rate hikes, although the impact on bitcoin is uncertain. The crypto seemed to gain momentum following the recent U.S. bank failures that caused worries about the conventional financial system, as investors shifted toward assets that retain value through good times and bad. Investors will also be weighing the first wave of quarterly earnings with banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup scheduled to report results. Analysts are expecting a largely downcast quarter, particularly in the hard-hit financial services sector. \u201cBTC is also being seen as a reliable store of value that lacks the issues that come with storing your money by way of a third-party intermediary, or a bank,\u201d Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO and chief legal officer of Banxa , a payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider to the crypto industry, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. \u201cThis is further supported by the decreasing correlation with the equity markets since 2021 \u2013 BTC is now properly starting to be perceived as a risk-off asset.\u201d Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, was cautiously optimistic about the sustainability of bitcoin\u2019s Monday surge. \u201cBitcoin is likely to find resistance at $30,000,\u201d DiPasquale noted in an email to CoinDesk. From a technical-analysis perspective, the current move is \u201ca retest of the range high established in March after the initial surge from under $20,000. Success of this test would see the price claiming $30,000 while a failure here should see BTC drop to $25,000, followed by $23,000.\u201d But he added: \u201cThe current price is also testing the lows of July 2021, where the market bounced back into another big rally.\u201d UPDATE (April 10, 2023, 22:27 UTC): Updates with bitcoin's most recent prices.

On April 9, letters from Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) were sent to Circle, BlockFi and 12 other non-crypto tech firms asking a series of questions on each firm\u2019s relationship with SVB. The lawmakers stated that more needs to be known about SVB\u2019s reported \u201ccoddling\u201d and \u201cwhite glove\u201d treatment towards its largest depositors in order to understand if these firms played a role in SVB\u2019s collapse. Jeremy Allaire and Zac Prince, the respective chief executives of Circle and BlockFi, were questioned on the length of their financial relationships with SVB and t amounts deposited with the bank, along with what \u201cagreements\u201d were made between their firms. In addition, the pair wanted to know if SVB offered \u201cperks\u201d such as low-interest rate mortgages or SVB-sponsored \u201cski trips, conferences and fancy dinners.\u201d \u201cCongress, bank regulators, and the public are owed an explanation for the bank\u2019s hyper-reliance on tech industry firms and investors,\" Warren and AOC wrote. Related: Polls suggest Elizabeth Warren\u2019s anti-crypto army strategy won\u2019t pay off They added the extent of SVB\u2019s depositors in the tech industry resulted \u201cin an abnormally high percentage of deposits\u201d not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and questioned the executives on \u201cthe role that companies like yours might have played in precipitating the $42 billion single-day-run on SVB.\u201d \u201cObtaining information on these factors is important for understanding how SVB failed and how to prevent the next failure,\u201d they added. Warren and AOC said they believe it may explain why some customers, such as Circle, placed extremely large amounts of uninsured deposits at SVB. Shortly after SVB collapsed, Circle disclosed that it had $3.3 billion tied up at SVB , while BlockFi was found to have $227 million in uninsured deposits with the bank.

                  "content": "While regulators and policymakers dither and try to decide if cryptocurrencies have a future in the economy, early adopters, including terrorists and violent extremists, are exploiting a law enforcement blind spot. The ease by which money laundering and terrorism financing take place with cryptocurrencies and the more dangerous privacy coins are becoming a security threat of our own making through bureaucratic inaction. The recent indictment of a New York woman accused of sending funds to Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham \u2014 designated by the United States and United Nations as a Foreign Terrorist Organization \u2014 is newsworthy because it\u2019s the exception, not the rule. But this does not necessarily mean that financing terrorism with cryptocurrencies is itself a rare event. Rather, the few prosecutions that have been announced reflect the limitations of law enforcement\u2019s capabilities in the United States and around the world \u2014 a problem that can and should be solved. The U.S. has only a small group of dedicated law enforcement personnel to track and seize cryptocurrencies used for criminal purposes. Agents responsible are also tasked with investigating all aspects of the misuse of cryptocurrencies ranging from extortion and money laundering to sanctions evasion and terrorism financing. This lack of specific focus broadens the potential for misuse of cryptocurrencies to be undetected, particularly in light of the steady migration by criminals to so-called privacy coins that encrypt wallets \u2014 like Monero \u2014 and in some cases also the transactions themselves. Related: CBDCs will lead to absolute government control In June 2020, my own Counter Extremism Project (CEP) located a notorious pro-ISIS website requesting Monero ( XMR ) cryptocurrency donations \u201cbecause it offers more privacy and safety features than Bitcoin.\u201d Months later, a website that supports the National Socialist Order and spreads violent neo-Nazi propaganda requested donations via Monero, and a neo-Nazi chat group on Telegram posted a guide on how to purchase Monero to the dark web. The neo-Nazi accelerationist group The Base, too, has requested cryptocurrency donations in Monero to facilitate training and unspecified equipment. Though the U.S. has the most advanced capacity to track and seize cryptocurrencies used for criminal purposes, these and other privacy coins present technical hurdles that no country has yet fully overcome. Their encryption technology renders law enforcement largely blind to who holds privacy coins and to what end they are used, and its users know it. The availability of so-called decentralized wallets, shareware downloadable from the internet, outside of cryptocurrency exchanges also provides another layer of anonymity by removing a third party that is responsible for fulfilling customer identification obligations and due diligence procedures. In May 2022, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs reported that \u201cthe IRS has had to develop new partnerships with private companies to attempt to develop a tool or solution for tracing Monero transactions\u201d and that \u201cregulators expressed concern over the use of privacy coins, noting that there is a \u2018substantial difference between more transparent cryptocurrency and more opaque transactions.\u2019\u201d Congress, however, has yet to create new regulatory frameworks or fund the development of new technological tools to the technical hurdles facing law enforcement that would ensure that the terrorism financing risks emanating from such privacy-enhancing, but transparency-reducing technologies are appropriately mitigated. In addition to blockchain analysis, officials should contemplate standards for behavior-based transaction monitoring and regulatory requirements for the tech industry to cooperate with law enforcement, given the intertwining use of cryptocurrencies, including privacy coins, with social media, messenger services and crowdfunding platforms. These service providers can and should become part of the first line of defense. Still, the tech industry is unlikely to focus on countering the misuse of its services for the financing of terrorism unless motivated by regulation and compelled by liability risks. Behavior-based monitoring by exchanges focuses on the actions of wallet holders and recognizes patterns that do not fit the usual behavior of users. If such suspicious patterns occur, they are flagged for further inspections to determine whether risks of money laundering, terrorism financing or other financial crimes occur. Exchanges have access to real-time user information that is broader than the information available to traditional financial institutions, which largely rely on information provided by their customers. For this powerful tool to be used more effectively, appropriate regulatory standards should be developed to guide its use by exchanges while adequately protecting user data. Related: Elizabeth Warren is pushing the Senate to ban your crypto wallet Stronger regulatory standards for content monitoring and Know Your Customer procedures for social media, messenger services and crowdfunding platforms are needed when these platforms are used for commercial purposes, such as through web shops or crowdfunding campaigns. These internet platforms presently operate purely on their own non-regulated standards, which presents an uneven defensive mechanism across various platforms and generally very low moderation standards. Noncustodial wallets and exchanges, as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) advises, should be considered high-risk technology. Therefore, their use outside of exchanges should always be considered as a strong indication of nefarious activity. If exchanges choose not to require users that hold noncustodial wallets to fully disclose their identity during a transaction involving such noncustodial wallets, it would be advisable that these exchanges do not process such transactions. Ultimately, only through governmental cooperation with industry stakeholders, combined with effective regulatory standards for the tech and fintech industries, can substantial progress be achieved and the risk of cryptocurrencies and privacy coins being used to fund extremism and terrorism be substantially reduced.

                  "description": "Crypto users are getting excited over the prospect of automating their trades with future-facing technologies built with the GPT-4 API.",
                  "content": "A recent spate of applications built on OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 API has the crypto community buzzing with designs toward the development of a fully-autonomous, self-correcting cryptocurrency trading bot. AutoGPT set to 100 runs. Goal: amalgamate best indicators for Crypto trading in Pine code. Result looping errors. Scavenged through output, found enough bits for GPT4 to give me strategy Pine code. 4hr backtested 2018 to now. $25 to $92M. Started test today, currently $1 profit Two such apps, dubbed \u201cBabyAGI\u201d and \u201cAutoGPT,\u201d have received particular notice, with many users attempting to build crypto trading applications on top of them. The big idea behind both apps involves task management for GPT-4. Currently, GPT-4 excels at natural language processing, as is evidenced by the demonstrable usefulness of the ChatGPT interface, but it has no capacity for memorization. Applications built on the GPT API are basically limited to single-session use, meaning the model can\u2019t recall information from previous interactions. This has to do with the amount of data (referred to as the number of \u201ctokens\u201d) that individual queries require, as well as GPT\u2019s tendency to hallucinate \u2014 a problem that becomes increasingly noticeable as token counts rise. Users are, essentially, starting with a clean slate whenever they query the machine. In terms of building a crypto trading application capable of self-correction and historiographic analysis \u2014 adjusting to real-time market conditions while simultaneously keeping short and long-term trends in focus \u2014 this means even the most robust bot built on the GPT API would typically require heavy human supervision. Related: Tech giant Alibaba to roll out ChatGPT competitor AI Some clever developers may have discerned a potential method for circumventing these limitations by building applications that take advantage of GPT\u2019s ability to generate code and connect to external sources. We\u2019ve seen our fair share of trading bots , but the goal of these particular apps goes beyond simply automating crypto news aggregation or teaching a machine learning agent how to recognize the dip. AutoGPT , for example, uses GPT-4 to generate code and then exploits GPT-3.5 to create what appears to be a virtual artificial memory space wherein information is combined and shuttled between the two. Another effort, BabyAGI , combines GPT-4 with LangChain, a coding framework, and Pinecone, a vector database, to spawn new agents in order to complete complex tasks without losing focus on the original objective. Both apps could have the potential to serve as the backbone for a multi-agent, fire-and-forget AI application capable of managing a crypto portfolio from top to bottom based on little more than plain language prompting. While it appears neither app was specifically designed with the cryptocurrency market in mind, we\u2019ve spotted several efforts across social media and on GitHub to adapt one or both for autonomous trading. #AutoGPT using #GPT4 finds another article on the Forbes website.

                  "content": "Disgraced Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes has been rebuffed in her attempt to stay out of federal prison while she appeals her conviction for the fraud she committed while overseeing a blood-testing scam that exposed Silicon Valley\u2019s dark side. In an 11-page ruling issued late Monday, U.S. District Judge Edward Davila concluded there wasn\u2019t compelling enough evidence to allow Holmes to remain free on bail while her lawyers try to persuade an appeals court that alleged misconduct during her four-month trial led to an unjust verdict. Advertisement The judge\u2019s decision means Holmes, 39, will have to surrender to authorities April 27 to start the more than 11-year prison sentence that Davila imposed in November. The punishment came 10 months after a jury found her guilty on four counts of fraud and conspiracy against the Thearanos investors who believed in her promises to revolutionize the health care industry. Holmes had accompanied her lawyers to a San Jose, California, courtroom on March 17 to try to convince Davila that various missteps by federal prosecutors, and the omission of key evidence, will culminate in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals exonerating her. Advertisement Holmes\u2019 prison sentence is scheduled to start roughly 20 years after she dropped out of Stanford University when she was 19 years old to start Theranos in Palo Alto, California \u2014 the same city where William Hewlett and David Packard founded a company bearing their surnames in a small garage and planted the seeds of what grew into Silicon Valley. Holmes could still file another appeal of Davila\u2019s latest ruling, a maneuver her co-conspirator at Theranos \u2014 Ramesh \u201cSunny\u201d Balwani \u2014 successfully used to delay his scheduled March 16 date to begin a nearly 13-year prison sentence. But the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals last week rejected that appeal, and Balwani is now scheduled to report to a Southern California prison on April 20. Davila has recommended Holmes serve her sentence in a Bryan, Texas, prison. It hasn\u2019t yet been publicly confirmed if that will be the facility where she reports. Unless she can find a way to stay free, Holmes will be separated from the two children she had leading up to the trial and after her conviction. Her first child, a boy, was born shortly before her trial began in September 2021. The youngest child, whose gender hasn\u2019t been disclosed in court documents, was born at some point after her November sentencing. She conceived both with her current partner, William \u201cBilly\u201d Evans, whom she met after breaking up with Balwani in the midst of Theranos\u2019 downfall. The denial of Holmes\u2019 request to remain free is the latest twist in a long-running saga that has already been the subject of an acclaimed HBO documentary and an award-winning Hulu TV series. Although they had separate trials, Holmes and Balwani were accused of essentially the same crimes centered on a ruse touting Theranos\u2019 blood-testing system as a breakthrough in health care. The claims helped the company become a Silicon Valley sensation that raised nearly $1 billion from investors and at one point anointed Holmes with a $4.5 billion fortune, based on her 50% stake in Theranos. Holmes also parlayed the buzz surrounding Theranos to speaking engagements on the same stage as former President Bill Clinton and glowing cover stories in business publications that likened her to tech visionaries such as Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Advertisement But Theranos\u2019 technology never came close to working like Holmes and Balwani boasted, resulting in the company\u2019s scandalous collapse and a criminal case that shined a bright light on Silicon Valley greed and hubris.",

                  "content": "Five years after the once highflying Chicago tech company Outcome Health began to unravel, a jury has found all three of its former leaders guilty of multiple counts of fraud , while acquitting them of several other counts. The jury deliberated for about two days before reaching its verdict Tuesday morning. The verdict followed a 10-week-long trial . Advertisement Jury members found Outcome co-founder and former CEO Rishi Shah guilty on 19 of 22 counts. They found co-founder and former President Shradha Agarwal guilty on 15 of 17 counts. The jury found Brad Purdy, the company\u2019s former chief operating officer and chief financial officer, guilty on 13 of 15 counts. Advertisement Some of the counts carry sentences of up to 30 years in prison. Any prison time will be decided during sentencing, but that hearing date has not yet been set. The verdict represented a stunning fall for the three who were once young stars of Chicago\u2019s tech scene. And it may have implications for others in the tech community, with parts of the case focusing on the line between startups\u2019 typical growing pains and fraud. A spokesperson for Shah, now 37, said that he hopes to appeal. \u201cToday\u2019s verdict deeply saddens Mr. Shah, and he will exhaust every avenue to overturn this result,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday. Theodore Poulos, an attorney for Purdy, 33, said in a statement Tuesday: \u201cWe are profoundly disappointed with the jury\u2019s verdict in this complex and nuanced case, particularly given the plethora of evidence adduced at trial, which showed that certain critical information was intentionally withheld from Brad Purdy. \u201cRegretfully, throughout his tenure at Outcome Health, he trusted and believed in his colleagues and failed to ask the questions that a more seasoned executive might have asked,\u201d Poulos said. \u201cBrad is an extremely honorable and intelligent young man and I have no doubt that he will be a very valuable member of the business world in the future, having learned very hard and costly lessons about that world in this case.\u201d Lawyers for Agarwal, 37, declined to comment Tuesday. Former Outcome Health President Shradha Agarwal, center left, leaves following the guilty verdict in the criminal fraud trial at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse, on April 11, 2023. (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) Outcome sold advertising to pharmaceutical companies, with the ads running on TVs and tablets that Outcome installed in doctors\u2019 offices and waiting rooms. During the trial, prosecutors alleged that Shah, Agarwal and Purdy lied about how many doctors\u2019 offices had screens and tablets running their content. Prosecutors said they then used those false numbers to overcharge drug companies for advertising, and inflated revenue figures used to get loans and raise money from investors. Advertisement Over the years, Outcome was able to raise nearly $1 billion from lenders and high-profile investors, including a fund co-founded by Gov. J.B. Pritzker and units of Goldman Sachs and Google. In 2011, Outcome had only 16 employees, but by 2017, the company had grown to more than 500 employees and had a reported valuation of more than $5 billion. That breakneck growth earned Outcome\u2019s founders Shah and Agarwal respect and riches. Shah, who owned 80% of Outcome, was named to the Forbes 400 ranking of richest Americans in 2017, with a net worth of $3.6 billion at the age of 31. Agarwal owned 20% of the company. Their success, however, began to crumble when a former Outcome analyst contacted the Wall Street Journal, which then ran a 2017 article revealing the alleged problems at Outcome. The company lost business, investors sued and Shah and Agarwal stepped down. In 2019, Outcome, as a company, agreed to pay $70 million to pharmaceutical companies to resolve a federal fraud investigation. The criminal fraud trial that just concluded focused on Outcome\u2019s three top executives as individuals. Throughout the case, defense attorneys placed the blame entirely on a fourth former Outcome employee, Ashik Desai . Desai had already pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud before the trial, and he testified that he falsified screen shots and return-on-investment reports without his bosses\u2019 knowledge. As part of an agreement with the government, Desai could get a reduced prison sentence for his testimony. Defense attorneys argued that the defendants trusted Desai, and he repeatedly reassured them that everything was aboveboard whenever questions arose. They argued that Desai was a master con man, who lied to his bosses to further his own career and feed his ego. Advertisement \u201cHe just lies and lies and lies,\u201d Poulos said of Desai during the trial. \u201cThat is his essence.\u201d Government prosecutors tried to poke holes in the theory that Desai acted without his bosses\u2019 knowledge by showing communications between the defendants, and, in some cases, Desai, in an attempt to demonstrate that they were aware of underdeliveries to clients and wanted to fire workers who raised concerns. Prosecutor Matthew Madden ridiculed the idea that Desai, who joined the company when he was 20 years old, was a criminal mastermind capable of completely deceiving his bosses. \u201cThe defendants were the CEO, the president and COO/CFO, the top three executives at the company,\u201d Madden told jurors during the trial. \u201cThey ran that business day-in and day-out for years, yet the lawyers have portrayed them as if they were truly clueless about the business they created and ran. ... It is laughable for them to suggest that Ashik outsmarted them.\u201d It was a complex case that featured about 1,500 exhibits, many in the forms of emails, documents, texts and voice messages. A number of the fraud counts on which the three were convicted were related to checks Outcome accepted for drug companies\u2019 advertisements despite not playing the drug companies\u2019 ads on enough screens. Others were related to money Outcome accepted from banks and investors after providing them with \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d information, according to prosecutors. Advertisement Shah and Agarwal were also convicted on a handful of counts having to do with an episode in which a newly hired executive left the company after only three weeks in 2017, after becoming concerned with Outcome\u2019s business practices. When the executive started raising concerns, Shah and Agarwal exchanged communications about whether to fire him and other employees who had tipped him off. Defense attorneys had argued that Shah and Agarwal were concerned that the executive didn\u2019t fit the company\u2019s culture, and had been reassured by Desai that nothing was amiss. The jury also found Shah guilty of two money laundering counts related to $450,000 that prosecutors said he spent to lease a Chicago home, and $65,000 he spent to hire a private jet for a weekend trip. Prosecutors said those dollars were proceeds of the bank fraud. Throughout the case, prosecutors argued that Outcome leaders believed it was acceptable for startups to fudge numbers and clean up later. It\u2019s an issue that has gained national attention in recent years after the fraud conviction of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, and legal actions surrounding the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Prosecutors highlighted a 2017 voice message from Shah to Purdy, regarding problems with affidavits, return-on-investment reports and forecasting at Outcome. \u201cIf you talk to people who were at Google or Facebook from, you know a hundred million to a billion (dollars), they will tell you these are normal things,\u201d Shah said. \u201cGoogle data was false and totally crazy in foreign markets in the early years.\u201d Advertisement Desai also said during his testimony that Shah had told him it was normal for startups to have \u201cmessy kitchens.\u201d The verdict Tuesday is a reminder that startups must follow the law, said Ira Weiss, a clinical professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, who was not involved in the trial. \u201cThere are limits to \u2018fake it til you make it,\u2019 \u201d Weiss said in an email after the verdict. \u201cOutcome Health had clearly gotten to the point where they had \u2018made it,\u2019 and once you get to that point, you must stop faking it.\u201d Shah\u2019s attorney, John Hueston, argued during the trial that Outcome was \u201cmaking it until Desai arrived and began faking it,\u201d while prosecutors alleged that Outcome had long been engaging in fraud. \u201cEven when they wanted to turn the corner and embark on making it, they knew that the truth about their fraud-filled growth could not see the light of day, not if they wanted to get $1 billion from their lenders and investors,\u201d prosecutor William Johnston said during the trial. Though they were criminally convicted Tuesday, Shah, Agarwal and Purdy still face charges from a civil lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over the fraud allegations. Two other former Outcome employees, Kathryn Choi, a former senior analyst, and Oliver Han, a former analyst, also previously both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and have not yet been sentenced.

                  "content": "Executives at the stablecoin issuer Circle and the bankrupt cryptocurrency lender BlockFi have been questioned by two members of Congress investigating the so-called \u201cmutual backscratching arrangements\u201d alleged to have taken place with the now-failed Silicon Valley Bank. On April 9, letters from Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) were sent to Circle, BlockFi and 12 other non-crypto tech firms asking a series of questions on each firm\u2019s relationship with SVB. The lawmakers stated that more needs to be known about SVB\u2019s reported \u201ccoddling\u201d and \u201cwhite glove\u201d treatment towards its largest depositors in order to understand if these firms played a role in SVB\u2019s collapse. Jeremy Allaire and Zac Prince, the respective chief executives of Circle and BlockFi, were questioned on the length of their financial relationships with SVB and t amounts deposited with the bank, along with what \u201cagreements\u201d were made between their firms. In addition, the pair wanted to know if SVB offered \u201cperks\u201d such as low-interest rate mortgages or SVB-sponsored \u201cski trips, conferences and fancy dinners.\u201d \u201cCongress, bank regulators, and the public are owed an explanation for the bank\u2019s hyper-reliance on tech industry firms and investors,\" Warren and AOC wrote. Related: Polls suggest Elizabeth Warren\u2019s anti-crypto army strategy won\u2019t pay off They added the extent of SVB\u2019s depositors in the tech industry resulted \u201cin an abnormally high percentage of deposits\u201d not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and questioned the executives on \u201cthe role that companies like yours might have played in precipitating the $42 billion single-day-run on SVB.\u201d \u201cObtaining information on these factors is important for understanding how SVB failed and how to prevent the next failure,\u201d they added. Warren and AOC said they believe it may explain why some customers, such as Circle, placed extremely large amounts of uninsured deposits at SVB. Shortly after SVB collapsed, Circle disclosed that it had $3.3 billion tied up at SVB , while BlockFi was found to have $227 million in uninsured deposits with the bank.

                  "content": "While regulators and policymakers dither and try to decide if cryptocurrencies have a future in the economy, early adopters, including terrorists and violent extremists, are exploiting a law enforcement blind spot. The ease by which money laundering and terrorism financing take place with cryptocurrencies and the more dangerous privacy coins are becoming a security threat of our own making through bureaucratic inaction. The recent indictment of a New York woman accused of sending funds to Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham \u2014 designated by the United States and United Nations as a Foreign Terrorist Organization \u2014 is newsworthy because it\u2019s the exception, not the rule. But this does not necessarily mean that financing terrorism with cryptocurrencies is itself a rare event. Rather, the few prosecutions that have been announced reflect the limitations of law enforcement\u2019s capabilities in the United States and around the world \u2014 a problem that can and should be solved. The U.S. has only a small group of dedicated law enforcement personnel to track and seize cryptocurrencies used for criminal purposes. Agents responsible are also tasked with investigating all aspects of the misuse of cryptocurrencies ranging from extortion and money laundering to sanctions evasion and terrorism financing. This lack of specific focus broadens the potential for misuse of cryptocurrencies to be undetected, particularly in light of the steady migration by criminals to so-called privacy coins that encrypt wallets \u2014 like Monero \u2014 and in some cases also the transactions themselves. Related: CBDCs will lead to absolute government control In June 2020, my own Counter Extremism Project (CEP) located a notorious pro-ISIS website requesting Monero ( XMR ) cryptocurrency donations \u201cbecause it offers more privacy and safety features than Bitcoin.\u201d Months later, a website that supports the National Socialist Order and spreads violent neo-Nazi propaganda requested donations via Monero, and a neo-Nazi chat group on Telegram posted a guide on how to purchase Monero to the dark web. The neo-Nazi accelerationist group The Base, too, has requested cryptocurrency donations in Monero to facilitate training and unspecified equipment. Though the U.S. has the most advanced capacity to track and seize cryptocurrencies used for criminal purposes, these and other privacy coins present technical hurdles that no country has yet fully overcome. Their encryption technology renders law enforcement largely blind to who holds privacy coins and to what end they are used, and its users know it. The availability of so-called decentralized wallets, shareware downloadable from the internet, outside of cryptocurrency exchanges also provides another layer of anonymity by removing a third party that is responsible for fulfilling customer identification obligations and due diligence procedures. In May 2022, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs reported that \u201cthe IRS has had to develop new partnerships with private companies to attempt to develop a tool or solution for tracing Monero transactions\u201d and that \u201cregulators expressed concern over the use of privacy coins, noting that there is a \u2018substantial difference between more transparent cryptocurrency and more opaque transactions.\u2019\u201d Congress, however, has yet to create new regulatory frameworks or fund the development of new technological tools to the technical hurdles facing law enforcement that would ensure that the terrorism financing risks emanating from such privacy-enhancing, but transparency-reducing technologies are appropriately mitigated. In addition to blockchain analysis, officials should contemplate standards for behavior-based transaction monitoring and regulatory requirements for the tech industry to cooperate with law enforcement, given the intertwining use of cryptocurrencies, including privacy coins, with social media, messenger services and crowdfunding platforms. These service providers can and should become part of the first line of defense. Still, the tech industry is unlikely to focus on countering the misuse of its services for the financing of terrorism unless motivated by regulation and compelled by liability risks. Behavior-based monitoring by exchanges focuses on the actions of wallet holders and recognizes patterns that do not fit the usual behavior of users. If such suspicious patterns occur, they are flagged for further inspections to determine whether risks of money laundering, terrorism financing or other financial crimes occur. Exchanges have access to real-time user information that is broader than the information available to traditional financial institutions, which largely rely on information provided by their customers. For this powerful tool to be used more effectively, appropriate regulatory standards should be developed to guide its use by exchanges while adequately protecting user data. Related: Elizabeth Warren is pushing the Senate to ban your crypto wallet Stronger regulatory standards for content monitoring and Know Your Customer procedures for social media, messenger services and crowdfunding platforms are needed when these platforms are used for commercial purposes, such as through web shops or crowdfunding campaigns. These internet platforms presently operate purely on their own non-regulated standards, which presents an uneven defensive mechanism across various platforms and generally very low moderation standards. Noncustodial wallets and exchanges, as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) advises, should be considered high-risk technology. Therefore, their use outside of exchanges should always be considered as a strong indication of nefarious activity. If exchanges choose not to require users that hold noncustodial wallets to fully disclose their identity during a transaction involving such noncustodial wallets, it would be advisable that these exchanges do not process such transactions. Ultimately, only through governmental cooperation with industry stakeholders, combined with effective regulatory standards for the tech and fintech industries, can substantial progress be achieved and the risk of cryptocurrencies and privacy coins being used to fund extremism and terrorism be substantially reduced.

                  "description": "Crypto users are getting excited over the prospect of automating their trades with future-facing technologies built with the GPT-4 API.",
                  "content": "A recent spate of applications built on OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 API has the crypto community buzzing with designs toward the development of a fully-autonomous, self-correcting cryptocurrency trading bot. AutoGPT set to 100 runs. Goal: amalgamate best indicators for Crypto trading in Pine code. Result looping errors. Scavenged through output, found enough bits for GPT4 to give me strategy Pine code. 4hr backtested 2018 to now. $25 to $92M. Started test today, currently $1 profit Two such apps, dubbed \u201cBabyAGI\u201d and \u201cAutoGPT,\u201d have received particular notice, with many users attempting to build crypto trading applications on top of them. The big idea behind both apps involves task management for GPT-4. Currently, GPT-4 excels at natural language processing, as is evidenced by the demonstrable usefulness of the ChatGPT interface, but it has no capacity for memorization. Applications built on the GPT API are basically limited to single-session use, meaning the model can\u2019t recall information from previous interactions. This has to do with the amount of data (referred to as the number of \u201ctokens\u201d) that individual queries require, as well as GPT\u2019s tendency to hallucinate \u2014 a problem that becomes increasingly noticeable as token counts rise. Users are, essentially, starting with a clean slate whenever they query the machine. In terms of building a crypto trading application capable of self-correction and historiographic analysis \u2014 adjusting to real-time market conditions while simultaneously keeping short and long-term trends in focus \u2014 this means even the most robust bot built on the GPT API would typically require heavy human supervision. Related: Tech giant Alibaba to roll out ChatGPT competitor AI Some clever developers may have discerned a potential method for circumventing these limitations by building applications that take advantage of GPT\u2019s ability to generate code and connect to external sources. We\u2019ve seen our fair share of trading bots , but the goal of these particular apps goes beyond simply automating crypto news aggregation or teaching a machine learning agent how to recognize the dip. AutoGPT , for example, uses GPT-4 to generate code and then exploits GPT-3.5 to create what appears to be a virtual artificial memory space wherein information is combined and shuttled between the two. Another effort, BabyAGI , combines GPT-4 with LangChain, a coding framework, and Pinecone, a vector database, to spawn new agents in order to complete complex tasks without losing focus on the original objective. Both apps could have the potential to serve as the backbone for a multi-agent, fire-and-forget AI application capable of managing a crypto portfolio from top to bottom based on little more than plain language prompting. While it appears neither app was specifically designed with the cryptocurrency market in mind, we\u2019ve spotted several efforts across social media and on GitHub to adapt one or both for autonomous trading. #AutoGPT using #GPT4 finds another article on the Forbes website.

                  "content": "Disgraced Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes has been rebuffed in her attempt to stay out of federal prison while she appeals her conviction for the fraud she committed while overseeing a blood-testing scam that exposed Silicon Valley\u2019s dark side. In an 11-page ruling issued late Monday, U.S. District Judge Edward Davila concluded there wasn\u2019t compelling enough evidence to allow Holmes to remain free on bail while her lawyers try to persuade an appeals court that alleged misconduct during her four-month trial led to an unjust verdict. Advertisement The judge\u2019s decision means Holmes, 39, will have to surrender to authorities April 27 to start the more than 11-year prison sentence that Davila imposed in November. The punishment came 10 months after a jury found her guilty on four counts of fraud and conspiracy against the Thearanos investors who believed in her promises to revolutionize the health care industry. Holmes had accompanied her lawyers to a San Jose, California, courtroom on March 17 to try to convince Davila that various missteps by federal prosecutors, and the omission of key evidence, will culminate in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals exonerating her. Advertisement Holmes\u2019 prison sentence is scheduled to start roughly 20 years after she dropped out of Stanford University when she was 19 years old to start Theranos in Palo Alto, California \u2014 the same city where William Hewlett and David Packard founded a company bearing their surnames in a small garage and planted the seeds of what grew into Silicon Valley. Holmes could still file another appeal of Davila\u2019s latest ruling, a maneuver her co-conspirator at Theranos \u2014 Ramesh \u201cSunny\u201d Balwani \u2014 successfully used to delay his scheduled March 16 date to begin a nearly 13-year prison sentence. But the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals last week rejected that appeal, and Balwani is now scheduled to report to a Southern California prison on April 20. Davila has recommended Holmes serve her sentence in a Bryan, Texas, prison. It hasn\u2019t yet been publicly confirmed if that will be the facility where she reports. Unless she can find a way to stay free, Holmes will be separated from the two children she had leading up to the trial and after her conviction. Her first child, a boy, was born shortly before her trial began in September 2021. The youngest child, whose gender hasn\u2019t been disclosed in court documents, was born at some point after her November sentencing. She conceived both with her current partner, William \u201cBilly\u201d Evans, whom she met after breaking up with Balwani in the midst of Theranos\u2019 downfall. The denial of Holmes\u2019 request to remain free is the latest twist in a long-running saga that has already been the subject of an acclaimed HBO documentary and an award-winning Hulu TV series. Although they had separate trials, Holmes and Balwani were accused of essentially the same crimes centered on a ruse touting Theranos\u2019 blood-testing system as a breakthrough in health care. The claims helped the company become a Silicon Valley sensation that raised nearly $1 billion from investors and at one point anointed Holmes with a $4.5 billion fortune, based on her 50% stake in Theranos. Holmes also parlayed the buzz surrounding Theranos to speaking engagements on the same stage as former President Bill Clinton and glowing cover stories in business publications that likened her to tech visionaries such as Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Advertisement But Theranos\u2019 technology never came close to working like Holmes and Balwani boasted, resulting in the company\u2019s scandalous collapse and a criminal case that shined a bright light on Silicon Valley greed and hubris.",

                  "content": "Five years after the once highflying Chicago tech company Outcome Health began to unravel, a jury has found all three of its former leaders guilty of multiple counts of fraud , while acquitting them of several other counts. The jury deliberated for about two days before reaching its verdict Tuesday morning. The verdict followed a 10-week-long trial . Advertisement Jury members found Outcome co-founder and former CEO Rishi Shah guilty on 19 of 22 counts. They found co-founder and former President Shradha Agarwal guilty on 15 of 17 counts. The jury found Brad Purdy, the company\u2019s former chief operating officer and chief financial officer, guilty on 13 of 15 counts. Advertisement Some of the counts carry sentences of up to 30 years in prison. Any prison time will be decided during sentencing, but that hearing date has not yet been set. The verdict represented a stunning fall for the three who were once young stars of Chicago\u2019s tech scene. And it may have implications for others in the tech community, with parts of the case focusing on the line between startups\u2019 typical growing pains and fraud. A spokesperson for Shah, now 37, said that he hopes to appeal. \u201cToday\u2019s verdict deeply saddens Mr. Shah, and he will exhaust every avenue to overturn this result,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday. Theodore Poulos, an attorney for Purdy, 33, said in a statement Tuesday: \u201cWe are profoundly disappointed with the jury\u2019s verdict in this complex and nuanced case, particularly given the plethora of evidence adduced at trial, which showed that certain critical information was intentionally withheld from Brad Purdy. \u201cRegretfully, throughout his tenure at Outcome Health, he trusted and believed in his colleagues and failed to ask the questions that a more seasoned executive might have asked,\u201d Poulos said. \u201cBrad is an extremely honorable and intelligent young man and I have no doubt that he will be a very valuable member of the business world in the future, having learned very hard and costly lessons about that world in this case.\u201d Lawyers for Agarwal, 37, declined to comment Tuesday. Former Outcome Health President Shradha Agarwal, center left, leaves following the guilty verdict in the criminal fraud trial at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse, on April 11, 2023. (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) Outcome sold advertising to pharmaceutical companies, with the ads running on TVs and tablets that Outcome installed in doctors\u2019 offices and waiting rooms. During the trial, prosecutors alleged that Shah, Agarwal and Purdy lied about how many doctors\u2019 offices had screens and tablets running their content. Prosecutors said they then used those false numbers to overcharge drug companies for advertising, and inflated revenue figures used to get loans and raise money from investors. Advertisement Over the years, Outcome was able to raise nearly $1 billion from lenders and high-profile investors, including a fund co-founded by Gov. J.B. Pritzker and units of Goldman Sachs and Google. In 2011, Outcome had only 16 employees, but by 2017, the company had grown to more than 500 employees and had a reported valuation of more than $5 billion. That breakneck growth earned Outcome\u2019s founders Shah and Agarwal respect and riches. Shah, who owned 80% of Outcome, was named to the Forbes 400 ranking of richest Americans in 2017, with a net worth of $3.6 billion at the age of 31. Agarwal owned 20% of the company. Their success, however, began to crumble when a former Outcome analyst contacted the Wall Street Journal, which then ran a 2017 article revealing the alleged problems at Outcome. The company lost business, investors sued and Shah and Agarwal stepped down. In 2019, Outcome, as a company, agreed to pay $70 million to pharmaceutical companies to resolve a federal fraud investigation. The criminal fraud trial that just concluded focused on Outcome\u2019s three top executives as individuals. Throughout the case, defense attorneys placed the blame entirely on a fourth former Outcome employee, Ashik Desai . Desai had already pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud before the trial, and he testified that he falsified screen shots and return-on-investment reports without his bosses\u2019 knowledge. As part of an agreement with the government, Desai could get a reduced prison sentence for his testimony. Defense attorneys argued that the defendants trusted Desai, and he repeatedly reassured them that everything was aboveboard whenever questions arose. They argued that Desai was a master con man, who lied to his bosses to further his own career and feed his ego. Advertisement \u201cHe just lies and lies and lies,\u201d Poulos said of Desai during the trial. \u201cThat is his essence.\u201d Government prosecutors tried to poke holes in the theory that Desai acted without his bosses\u2019 knowledge by showing communications between the defendants, and, in some cases, Desai, in an attempt to demonstrate that they were aware of underdeliveries to clients and wanted to fire workers who raised concerns. Prosecutor Matthew Madden ridiculed the idea that Desai, who joined the company when he was 20 years old, was a criminal mastermind capable of completely deceiving his bosses. \u201cThe defendants were the CEO, the president and COO/CFO, the top three executives at the company,\u201d Madden told jurors during the trial. \u201cThey ran that business day-in and day-out for years, yet the lawyers have portrayed them as if they were truly clueless about the business they created and ran. ... It is laughable for them to suggest that Ashik outsmarted them.\u201d It was a complex case that featured about 1,500 exhibits, many in the forms of emails, documents, texts and voice messages. A number of the fraud counts on which the three were convicted were related to checks Outcome accepted for drug companies\u2019 advertisements despite not playing the drug companies\u2019 ads on enough screens. Others were related to money Outcome accepted from banks and investors after providing them with \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d information, according to prosecutors. Advertisement Shah and Agarwal were also convicted on a handful of counts having to do with an episode in which a newly hired executive left the company after only three weeks in 2017, after becoming concerned with Outcome\u2019s business practices. When the executive started raising concerns, Shah and Agarwal exchanged communications about whether to fire him and other employees who had tipped him off. Defense attorneys had argued that Shah and Agarwal were concerned that the executive didn\u2019t fit the company\u2019s culture, and had been reassured by Desai that nothing was amiss. The jury also found Shah guilty of two money laundering counts related to $450,000 that prosecutors said he spent to lease a Chicago home, and $65,000 he spent to hire a private jet for a weekend trip. Prosecutors said those dollars were proceeds of the bank fraud. Throughout the case, prosecutors argued that Outcome leaders believed it was acceptable for startups to fudge numbers and clean up later. It\u2019s an issue that has gained national attention in recent years after the fraud conviction of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, and legal actions surrounding the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Prosecutors highlighted a 2017 voice message from Shah to Purdy, regarding problems with affidavits, return-on-investment reports and forecasting at Outcome. \u201cIf you talk to people who were at Google or Facebook from, you know a hundred million to a billion (dollars), they will tell you these are normal things,\u201d Shah said. \u201cGoogle data was false and totally crazy in foreign markets in the early years.\u201d Advertisement Desai also said during his testimony that Shah had told him it was normal for startups to have \u201cmessy kitchens.\u201d The verdict Tuesday is a reminder that startups must follow the law, said Ira Weiss, a clinical professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, who was not involved in the trial. \u201cThere are limits to \u2018fake it til you make it,\u2019 \u201d Weiss said in an email after the verdict. \u201cOutcome Health had clearly gotten to the point where they had \u2018made it,\u2019 and once you get to that point, you must stop faking it.\u201d Shah\u2019s attorney, John Hueston, argued during the trial that Outcome was \u201cmaking it until Desai arrived and began faking it,\u201d while prosecutors alleged that Outcome had long been engaging in fraud. \u201cEven when they wanted to turn the corner and embark on making it, they knew that the truth about their fraud-filled growth could not see the light of day, not if they wanted to get $1 billion from their lenders and investors,\u201d prosecutor William Johnston said during the trial. Though they were criminally convicted Tuesday, Shah, Agarwal and Purdy still face charges from a civil lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over the fraud allegations. Two other former Outcome employees, Kathryn Choi, a former senior analyst, and Oliver Han, a former analyst, also previously both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and have not yet been sentenced.

                  "content": "Executives at the stablecoin issuer Circle and the bankrupt cryptocurrency lender BlockFi have been questioned by two members of Congress investigating the so-called \u201cmutual backscratching arrangements\u201d alleged to have taken place with the now-failed Silicon Valley Bank. On April 9, letters from Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) were sent to Circle, BlockFi and 12 other non-crypto tech firms asking a series of questions on each firm\u2019s relationship with SVB. The lawmakers stated that more needs to be known about SVB\u2019s reported \u201ccoddling\u201d and \u201cwhite glove\u201d treatment towards its largest depositors in order to understand if these firms played a role in SVB\u2019s collapse. Jeremy Allaire and Zac Prince, the respective chief executives of Circle and BlockFi, were questioned on the length of their financial relationships with SVB and t amounts deposited with the bank, along with what \u201cagreements\u201d were made between their firms. In addition, the pair wanted to know if SVB offered \u201cperks\u201d such as low-interest rate mortgages or SVB-sponsored \u201cski trips, conferences and fancy dinners.\u201d \u201cCongress, bank regulators, and the public are owed an explanation for the bank\u2019s hyper-reliance on tech industry firms and investors,\" Warren and AOC wrote. Related: Polls suggest Elizabeth Warren\u2019s anti-crypto army strategy won\u2019t pay off They added the extent of SVB\u2019s depositors in the tech industry resulted \u201cin an abnormally high percentage of deposits\u201d not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and questioned the executives on \u201cthe role that companies like yours might have played in precipitating the $42 billion single-day-run on SVB.\u201d \u201cObtaining information on these factors is important for understanding how SVB failed and how to prevent the next failure,\u201d they added. Warren and AOC said they believe it may explain why some customers, such as Circle, placed extremely large amounts of uninsured deposits at SVB. Shortly after SVB collapsed, Circle disclosed that it had $3.3 billion tied up at SVB , while BlockFi was found to have $227 million in uninsured deposits with the bank.

                  "content": "While regulators and policymakers dither and try to decide if cryptocurrencies have a future in the economy, early adopters, including terrorists and violent extremists, are exploiting a law enforcement blind spot. The ease by which money laundering and terrorism financing take place with cryptocurrencies and the more dangerous privacy coins are becoming a security threat of our own making through bureaucratic inaction. The recent indictment of a New York woman accused of sending funds to Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham \u2014 designated by the United States and United Nations as a Foreign Terrorist Organization \u2014 is newsworthy because it\u2019s the exception, not the rule. But this does not necessarily mean that financing terrorism with cryptocurrencies is itself a rare event. Rather, the few prosecutions that have been announced reflect the limitations of law enforcement\u2019s capabilities in the United States and around the world \u2014 a problem that can and should be solved. The U.S. has only a small group of dedicated law enforcement personnel to track and seize cryptocurrencies used for criminal purposes. Agents responsible are also tasked with investigating all aspects of the misuse of cryptocurrencies ranging from extortion and money laundering to sanctions evasion and terrorism financing. This lack of specific focus broadens the potential for misuse of cryptocurrencies to be undetected, particularly in light of the steady migration by criminals to so-called privacy coins that encrypt wallets \u2014 like Monero \u2014 and in some cases also the transactions themselves. Related: CBDCs will lead to absolute government control In June 2020, my own Counter Extremism Project (CEP) located a notorious pro-ISIS website requesting Monero ( XMR ) cryptocurrency donations \u201cbecause it offers more privacy and safety features than Bitcoin.\u201d Months later, a website that supports the National Socialist Order and spreads violent neo-Nazi propaganda requested donations via Monero, and a neo-Nazi chat group on Telegram posted a guide on how to purchase Monero to the dark web. The neo-Nazi accelerationist group The Base, too, has requested cryptocurrency donations in Monero to facilitate training and unspecified equipment. Though the U.S. has the most advanced capacity to track and seize cryptocurrencies used for criminal purposes, these and other privacy coins present technical hurdles that no country has yet fully overcome. Their encryption technology renders law enforcement largely blind to who holds privacy coins and to what end they are used, and its users know it. The availability of so-called decentralized wallets, shareware downloadable from the internet, outside of cryptocurrency exchanges also provides another layer of anonymity by removing a third party that is responsible for fulfilling customer identification obligations and due diligence procedures. In May 2022, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs reported that \u201cthe IRS has had to develop new partnerships with private companies to attempt to develop a tool or solution for tracing Monero transactions\u201d and that \u201cregulators expressed concern over the use of privacy coins, noting that there is a \u2018substantial difference between more transparent cryptocurrency and more opaque transactions.\u2019\u201d Congress, however, has yet to create new regulatory frameworks or fund the development of new technological tools to the technical hurdles facing law enforcement that would ensure that the terrorism financing risks emanating from such privacy-enhancing, but transparency-reducing technologies are appropriately mitigated. In addition to blockchain analysis, officials should contemplate standards for behavior-based transaction monitoring and regulatory requirements for the tech industry to cooperate with law enforcement, given the intertwining use of cryptocurrencies, including privacy coins, with social media, messenger services and crowdfunding platforms. These service providers can and should become part of the first line of defense. Still, the tech industry is unlikely to focus on countering the misuse of its services for the financing of terrorism unless motivated by regulation and compelled by liability risks. Behavior-based monitoring by exchanges focuses on the actions of wallet holders and recognizes patterns that do not fit the usual behavior of users. If such suspicious patterns occur, they are flagged for further inspections to determine whether risks of money laundering, terrorism financing or other financial crimes occur. Exchanges have access to real-time user information that is broader than the information available to traditional financial institutions, which largely rely on information provided by their customers. For this powerful tool to be used more effectively, appropriate regulatory standards should be developed to guide its use by exchanges while adequately protecting user data. Related: Elizabeth Warren is pushing the Senate to ban your crypto wallet Stronger regulatory standards for content monitoring and Know Your Customer procedures for social media, messenger services and crowdfunding platforms are needed when these platforms are used for commercial purposes, such as through web shops or crowdfunding campaigns. These internet platforms presently operate purely on their own non-regulated standards, which presents an uneven defensive mechanism across various platforms and generally very low moderation standards. Noncustodial wallets and exchanges, as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) advises, should be considered high-risk technology. Therefore, their use outside of exchanges should always be considered as a strong indication of nefarious activity. If exchanges choose not to require users that hold noncustodial wallets to fully disclose their identity during a transaction involving such noncustodial wallets, it would be advisable that these exchanges do not process such transactions. Ultimately, only through governmental cooperation with industry stakeholders, combined with effective regulatory standards for the tech and fintech industries, can substantial progress be achieved and the risk of cryptocurrencies and privacy coins being used to fund extremism and terrorism be substantially reduced.

                  "content": "A recent spate of applications built on OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 API has the crypto community buzzing with designs toward the development of a fully-autonomous, self-correcting cryptocurrency trading bot. AutoGPT set to 100 runs. Goal: amalgamate best indicators for Crypto trading in Pine code. Result looping errors. Scavenged through output, found enough bits for GPT4 to give me strategy Pine code. 4hr backtested 2018 to now. $25 to $92M. Started test today, currently $1 profit Two such apps, dubbed \u201cBabyAGI\u201d and \u201cAutoGPT,\u201d have received particular notice, with many users attempting to build crypto trading applications on top of them. The big idea behind both apps involves task management for GPT-4. Currently, GPT-4 excels at natural language processing, as is evidenced by the demonstrable usefulness of the ChatGPT interface, but it has no capacity for memorization. Applications built on the GPT API are basically limited to single-session use, meaning the model can\u2019t recall information from previous interactions. This has to do with the amount of data (referred to as the number of \u201ctokens\u201d) that individual queries require, as well as GPT\u2019s tendency to hallucinate \u2014 a problem that becomes increasingly noticeable as token counts rise. Users are, essentially, starting with a clean slate whenever they query the machine. In terms of building a crypto trading application capable of self-correction and historiographic analysis \u2014 adjusting to real-time market conditions while simultaneously keeping short and long-term trends in focus \u2014 this means even the most robust bot built on the GPT API would typically require heavy human supervision. Related: Tech giant Alibaba to roll out ChatGPT competitor AI Some clever developers may have discerned a potential method for circumventing these limitations by building applications that take advantage of GPT\u2019s ability to generate code and connect to external sources. We\u2019ve seen our fair share of trading bots , but the goal of these particular apps goes beyond simply automating crypto news aggregation or teaching a machine learning agent how to recognize the dip. AutoGPT , for example, uses GPT-4 to generate code and then exploits GPT-3.5 to create what appears to be a virtual artificial memory space wherein information is combined and shuttled between the two. Another effort, BabyAGI , combines GPT-4 with LangChain, a coding framework, and Pinecone, a vector database, to spawn new agents in order to complete complex tasks without losing focus on the original objective. Both apps could have the potential to serve as the backbone for a multi-agent, fire-and-forget AI application capable of managing a crypto portfolio from top to bottom based on little more than plain language prompting. While it appears neither app was specifically designed with the cryptocurrency market in mind, we\u2019ve spotted several efforts across social media and on GitHub to adapt one or both for autonomous trading. #AutoGPT using #GPT4 finds another article on the Forbes website.

                  "content": "Disgraced Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes has been rebuffed in her attempt to stay out of federal prison while she appeals her conviction for the fraud she committed while overseeing a blood-testing scam that exposed Silicon Valley\u2019s dark side. In an 11-page ruling issued late Monday, U.S. District Judge Edward Davila concluded there wasn\u2019t compelling enough evidence to allow Holmes to remain free on bail while her lawyers try to persuade an appeals court that alleged misconduct during her four-month trial led to an unjust verdict. Advertisement The judge\u2019s decision means Holmes, 39, will have to surrender to authorities April 27 to start the more than 11-year prison sentence that Davila imposed in November. The punishment came 10 months after a jury found her guilty on four counts of fraud and conspiracy against the Thearanos investors who believed in her promises to revolutionize the health care industry. Holmes had accompanied her lawyers to a San Jose, California, courtroom on March 17 to try to convince Davila that various missteps by federal prosecutors, and the omission of key evidence, will culminate in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals exonerating her. Advertisement Holmes\u2019 prison sentence is scheduled to start roughly 20 years after she dropped out of Stanford University when she was 19 years old to start Theranos in Palo Alto, California \u2014 the same city where William Hewlett and David Packard founded a company bearing their surnames in a small garage and planted the seeds of what grew into Silicon Valley. Holmes could still file another appeal of Davila\u2019s latest ruling, a maneuver her co-conspirator at Theranos \u2014 Ramesh \u201cSunny\u201d Balwani \u2014 successfully used to delay his scheduled March 16 date to begin a nearly 13-year prison sentence. But the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals last week rejected that appeal, and Balwani is now scheduled to report to a Southern California prison on April 20. Davila has recommended Holmes serve her sentence in a Bryan, Texas, prison. It hasn\u2019t yet been publicly confirmed if that will be the facility where she reports. Unless she can find a way to stay free, Holmes will be separated from the two children she had leading up to the trial and after her conviction. Her first child, a boy, was born shortly before her trial began in September 2021. The youngest child, whose gender hasn\u2019t been disclosed in court documents, was born at some point after her November sentencing. She conceived both with her current partner, William \u201cBilly\u201d Evans, whom she met after breaking up with Balwani in the midst of Theranos\u2019 downfall. The denial of Holmes\u2019 request to remain free is the latest twist in a long-running saga that has already been the subject of an acclaimed HBO documentary and an award-winning Hulu TV series. Although they had separate trials, Holmes and Balwani were accused of essentially the same crimes centered on a ruse touting Theranos\u2019 blood-testing system as a breakthrough in health care. The claims helped the company become a Silicon Valley sensation that raised nearly $1 billion from investors and at one point anointed Holmes with a $4.5 billion fortune, based on her 50% stake in Theranos. Holmes also parlayed the buzz surrounding Theranos to speaking engagements on the same stage as former President Bill Clinton and glowing cover stories in business publications that likened her to tech visionaries such as Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Advertisement But Theranos\u2019 technology never came close to working like Holmes and Balwani boasted, resulting in the company\u2019s scandalous collapse and a criminal case that shined a bright light on Silicon Valley greed and hubris.",

                  "content": "Five years after the once highflying Chicago tech company Outcome Health began to unravel, a jury has found all three of its former leaders guilty of multiple counts of fraud , while acquitting them of several other counts. The jury deliberated for about two days before reaching its verdict Tuesday morning. The verdict followed a 10-week-long trial . Advertisement Jury members found Outcome co-founder and former CEO Rishi Shah guilty on 19 of 22 counts. They found co-founder and former President Shradha Agarwal guilty on 15 of 17 counts. The jury found Brad Purdy, the company\u2019s former chief operating officer and chief financial officer, guilty on 13 of 15 counts. Advertisement Some of the counts carry sentences of up to 30 years in prison. Any prison time will be decided during sentencing, but that hearing date has not yet been set. The verdict represented a stunning fall for the three who were once young stars of Chicago\u2019s tech scene. And it may have implications for others in the tech community, with parts of the case focusing on the line between startups\u2019 typical growing pains and fraud. A spokesperson for Shah, now 37, said that he hopes to appeal. \u201cToday\u2019s verdict deeply saddens Mr. Shah, and he will exhaust every avenue to overturn this result,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday. Theodore Poulos, an attorney for Purdy, 33, said in a statement Tuesday: \u201cWe are profoundly disappointed with the jury\u2019s verdict in this complex and nuanced case, particularly given the plethora of evidence adduced at trial, which showed that certain critical information was intentionally withheld from Brad Purdy. \u201cRegretfully, throughout his tenure at Outcome Health, he trusted and believed in his colleagues and failed to ask the questions that a more seasoned executive might have asked,\u201d Poulos said. \u201cBrad is an extremely honorable and intelligent young man and I have no doubt that he will be a very valuable member of the business world in the future, having learned very hard and costly lessons about that world in this case.\u201d Lawyers for Agarwal, 37, declined to comment Tuesday. Former Outcome Health President Shradha Agarwal, center left, leaves following the guilty verdict in the criminal fraud trial at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse, on April 11, 2023. (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) Outcome sold advertising to pharmaceutical companies, with the ads running on TVs and tablets that Outcome installed in doctors\u2019 offices and waiting rooms. During the trial, prosecutors alleged that Shah, Agarwal and Purdy lied about how many doctors\u2019 offices had screens and tablets running their content. Prosecutors said they then used those false numbers to overcharge drug companies for advertising, and inflated revenue figures used to get loans and raise money from investors. Advertisement Over the years, Outcome was able to raise nearly $1 billion from lenders and high-profile investors, including a fund co-founded by Gov. J.B. Pritzker and units of Goldman Sachs and Google. In 2011, Outcome had only 16 employees, but by 2017, the company had grown to more than 500 employees and had a reported valuation of more than $5 billion. That breakneck growth earned Outcome\u2019s founders Shah and Agarwal respect and riches. Shah, who owned 80% of Outcome, was named to the Forbes 400 ranking of richest Americans in 2017, with a net worth of $3.6 billion at the age of 31. Agarwal owned 20% of the company. Their success, however, began to crumble when a former Outcome analyst contacted the Wall Street Journal, which then ran a 2017 article revealing the alleged problems at Outcome. The company lost business, investors sued and Shah and Agarwal stepped down. In 2019, Outcome, as a company, agreed to pay $70 million to pharmaceutical companies to resolve a federal fraud investigation. The criminal fraud trial that just concluded focused on Outcome\u2019s three top executives as individuals. Throughout the case, defense attorneys placed the blame entirely on a fourth former Outcome employee, Ashik Desai . Desai had already pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud before the trial, and he testified that he falsified screen shots and return-on-investment reports without his bosses\u2019 knowledge. As part of an agreement with the government, Desai could get a reduced prison sentence for his testimony. Defense attorneys argued that the defendants trusted Desai, and he repeatedly reassured them that everything was aboveboard whenever questions arose. They argued that Desai was a master con man, who lied to his bosses to further his own career and feed his ego. Advertisement \u201cHe just lies and lies and lies,\u201d Poulos said of Desai during the trial. \u201cThat is his essence.\u201d Government prosecutors tried to poke holes in the theory that Desai acted without his bosses\u2019 knowledge by showing communications between the defendants, and, in some cases, Desai, in an attempt to demonstrate that they were aware of underdeliveries to clients and wanted to fire workers who raised concerns. Prosecutor Matthew Madden ridiculed the idea that Desai, who joined the company when he was 20 years old, was a criminal mastermind capable of completely deceiving his bosses. \u201cThe defendants were the CEO, the president and COO/CFO, the top three executives at the company,\u201d Madden told jurors during the trial. \u201cThey ran that business day-in and day-out for years, yet the lawyers have portrayed them as if they were truly clueless about the business they created and ran. ... It is laughable for them to suggest that Ashik outsmarted them.\u201d It was a complex case that featured about 1,500 exhibits, many in the forms of emails, documents, texts and voice messages. A number of the fraud counts on which the three were convicted were related to checks Outcome accepted for drug companies\u2019 advertisements despite not playing the drug companies\u2019 ads on enough screens. Others were related to money Outcome accepted from banks and investors after providing them with \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d information, according to prosecutors. Advertisement Shah and Agarwal were also convicted on a handful of counts having to do with an episode in which a newly hired executive left the company after only three weeks in 2017, after becoming concerned with Outcome\u2019s business practices. When the executive started raising concerns, Shah and Agarwal exchanged communications about whether to fire him and other employees who had tipped him off. Defense attorneys had argued that Shah and Agarwal were concerned that the executive didn\u2019t fit the company\u2019s culture, and had been reassured by Desai that nothing was amiss. The jury also found Shah guilty of two money laundering counts related to $450,000 that prosecutors said he spent to lease a Chicago home, and $65,000 he spent to hire a private jet for a weekend trip. Prosecutors said those dollars were proceeds of the bank fraud. Throughout the case, prosecutors argued that Outcome leaders believed it was acceptable for startups to fudge numbers and clean up later. It\u2019s an issue that has gained national attention in recent years after the fraud conviction of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, and legal actions surrounding the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Prosecutors highlighted a 2017 voice message from Shah to Purdy, regarding problems with affidavits, return-on-investment reports and forecasting at Outcome. \u201cIf you talk to people who were at Google or Facebook from, you know a hundred million to a billion (dollars), they will tell you these are normal things,\u201d Shah said. \u201cGoogle data was false and totally crazy in foreign markets in the early years.\u201d Advertisement Desai also said during his testimony that Shah had told him it was normal for startups to have \u201cmessy kitchens.\u201d The verdict Tuesday is a reminder that startups must follow the law, said Ira Weiss, a clinical professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, who was not involved in the trial. \u201cThere are limits to \u2018fake it til you make it,\u2019 \u201d Weiss said in an email after the verdict. \u201cOutcome Health had clearly gotten to the point where they had \u2018made it,\u2019 and once you get to that point, you must stop faking it.\u201d Shah\u2019s attorney, John Hueston, argued during the trial that Outcome was \u201cmaking it until Desai arrived and began faking it,\u201d while prosecutors alleged that Outcome had long been engaging in fraud. \u201cEven when they wanted to turn the corner and embark on making it, they knew that the truth about their fraud-filled growth could not see the light of day, not if they wanted to get $1 billion from their lenders and investors,\u201d prosecutor William Johnston said during the trial. Though they were criminally convicted Tuesday, Shah, Agarwal and Purdy still face charges from a civil lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over the fraud allegations. Two other former Outcome employees, Kathryn Choi, a former senior analyst, and Oliver Han, a former analyst, also previously both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and have not yet been sentenced.

On April 9, letters from Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) were sent to Circle, BlockFi and 12 other non-crypto tech firms asking a series of questions on each firm\u2019s relationship with SVB. The lawmakers stated that more needs to be known about SVB\u2019s reported \u201ccoddling\u201d and \u201cwhite glove\u201d treatment towards its largest depositors in order to understand if these firms played a role in SVB\u2019s collapse. Jeremy Allaire and Zac Prince, the respective chief executives of Circle and BlockFi, were questioned on the length of their financial relationships with SVB and t amounts deposited with the bank, along with what \u201cagreements\u201d were made between their firms. In addition, the pair wanted to know if SVB offered \u201cperks\u201d such as low-interest rate mortgages or SVB-sponsored \u201cski trips, conferences and fancy dinners.\u201d \u201cCongress, bank regulators, and the public are owed an explanation for the bank\u2019s hyper-reliance on tech industry firms and investors,\" Warren and AOC wrote. Related: Polls suggest Elizabeth Warren\u2019s anti-crypto army strategy won\u2019t pay off They added the extent of SVB\u2019s depositors in the tech industry resulted \u201cin an abnormally high percentage of deposits\u201d not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and questioned the executives on \u201cthe role that companies like yours might have played in precipitating the $42 billion single-day-run on SVB.\u201d \u201cObtaining information on these factors is important for understanding how SVB failed and how to prevent the next failure,\u201d they added. Warren and AOC said they believe it may explain why some customers, such as Circle, placed extremely large amounts of uninsured deposits at SVB. Shortly after SVB collapsed, Circle disclosed that it had $3.3 billion tied up at SVB , while BlockFi was found to have $227 million in uninsured deposits with the bank.

                  "content": "While regulators and policymakers dither and try to decide if cryptocurrencies have a future in the economy, early adopters, including terrorists and violent extremists, are exploiting a law enforcement blind spot. The ease by which money laundering and terrorism financing take place with cryptocurrencies and the more dangerous privacy coins are becoming a security threat of our own making through bureaucratic inaction. The recent indictment of a New York woman accused of sending funds to Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham \u2014 designated by the United States and United Nations as a Foreign Terrorist Organization \u2014 is newsworthy because it\u2019s the exception, not the rule. But this does not necessarily mean that financing terrorism with cryptocurrencies is itself a rare event. Rather, the few prosecutions that have been announced reflect the limitations of law enforcement\u2019s capabilities in the United States and around the world \u2014 a problem that can and should be solved. The U.S. has only a small group of dedicated law enforcement personnel to track and seize cryptocurrencies used for criminal purposes. Agents responsible are also tasked with investigating all aspects of the misuse of cryptocurrencies ranging from extortion and money laundering to sanctions evasion and terrorism financing. This lack of specific focus broadens the potential for misuse of cryptocurrencies to be undetected, particularly in light of the steady migration by criminals to so-called privacy coins that encrypt wallets \u2014 like Monero \u2014 and in some cases also the transactions themselves. Related: CBDCs will lead to absolute government control In June 2020, my own Counter Extremism Project (CEP) located a notorious pro-ISIS website requesting Monero ( XMR ) cryptocurrency donations \u201cbecause it offers more privacy and safety features than Bitcoin.\u201d Months later, a website that supports the National Socialist Order and spreads violent neo-Nazi propaganda requested donations via Monero, and a neo-Nazi chat group on Telegram posted a guide on how to purchase Monero to the dark web. The neo-Nazi accelerationist group The Base, too, has requested cryptocurrency donations in Monero to facilitate training and unspecified equipment. Though the U.S. has the most advanced capacity to track and seize cryptocurrencies used for criminal purposes, these and other privacy coins present technical hurdles that no country has yet fully overcome. Their encryption technology renders law enforcement largely blind to who holds privacy coins and to what end they are used, and its users know it. The availability of so-called decentralized wallets, shareware downloadable from the internet, outside of cryptocurrency exchanges also provides another layer of anonymity by removing a third party that is responsible for fulfilling customer identification obligations and due diligence procedures. In May 2022, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs reported that \u201cthe IRS has had to develop new partnerships with private companies to attempt to develop a tool or solution for tracing Monero transactions\u201d and that \u201cregulators expressed concern over the use of privacy coins, noting that there is a \u2018substantial difference between more transparent cryptocurrency and more opaque transactions.\u2019\u201d Congress, however, has yet to create new regulatory frameworks or fund the development of new technological tools to the technical hurdles facing law enforcement that would ensure that the terrorism financing risks emanating from such privacy-enhancing, but transparency-reducing technologies are appropriately mitigated. In addition to blockchain analysis, officials should contemplate standards for behavior-based transaction monitoring and regulatory requirements for the tech industry to cooperate with law enforcement, given the intertwining use of cryptocurrencies, including privacy coins, with social media, messenger services and crowdfunding platforms. These service providers can and should become part of the first line of defense. Still, the tech industry is unlikely to focus on countering the misuse of its services for the financing of terrorism unless motivated by regulation and compelled by liability risks. Behavior-based monitoring by exchanges focuses on the actions of wallet holders and recognizes patterns that do not fit the usual behavior of users. If such suspicious patterns occur, they are flagged for further inspections to determine whether risks of money laundering, terrorism financing or other financial crimes occur. Exchanges have access to real-time user information that is broader than the information available to traditional financial institutions, which largely rely on information provided by their customers. For this powerful tool to be used more effectively, appropriate regulatory standards should be developed to guide its use by exchanges while adequately protecting user data. Related: Elizabeth Warren is pushing the Senate to ban your crypto wallet Stronger regulatory standards for content monitoring and Know Your Customer procedures for social media, messenger services and crowdfunding platforms are needed when these platforms are used for commercial purposes, such as through web shops or crowdfunding campaigns. These internet platforms presently operate purely on their own non-regulated standards, which presents an uneven defensive mechanism across various platforms and generally very low moderation standards. Noncustodial wallets and exchanges, as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) advises, should be considered high-risk technology. Therefore, their use outside of exchanges should always be considered as a strong indication of nefarious activity. If exchanges choose not to require users that hold noncustodial wallets to fully disclose their identity during a transaction involving such noncustodial wallets, it would be advisable that these exchanges do not process such transactions. Ultimately, only through governmental cooperation with industry stakeholders, combined with effective regulatory standards for the tech and fintech industries, can substantial progress be achieved and the risk of cryptocurrencies and privacy coins being used to fund extremism and terrorism be substantially reduced.

                  "description": "Crypto users are getting excited over the prospect of automating their trades with future-facing technologies built with the GPT-4 API.",
                  "content": "A recent spate of applications built on OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 API has the crypto community buzzing with designs toward the development of a fully-autonomous, self-correcting cryptocurrency trading bot. AutoGPT set to 100 runs. Goal: amalgamate best indicators for Crypto trading in Pine code. Result looping errors. Scavenged through output, found enough bits for GPT4 to give me strategy Pine code. 4hr backtested 2018 to now. $25 to $92M. Started test today, currently $1 profit Two such apps, dubbed \u201cBabyAGI\u201d and \u201cAutoGPT,\u201d have received particular notice, with many users attempting to build crypto trading applications on top of them. The big idea behind both apps involves task management for GPT-4. Currently, GPT-4 excels at natural language processing, as is evidenced by the demonstrable usefulness of the ChatGPT interface, but it has no capacity for memorization. Applications built on the GPT API are basically limited to single-session use, meaning the model can\u2019t recall information from previous interactions. This has to do with the amount of data (referred to as the number of \u201ctokens\u201d) that individual queries require, as well as GPT\u2019s tendency to hallucinate \u2014 a problem that becomes increasingly noticeable as token counts rise. Users are, essentially, starting with a clean slate whenever they query the machine. In terms of building a crypto trading application capable of self-correction and historiographic analysis \u2014 adjusting to real-time market conditions while simultaneously keeping short and long-term trends in focus \u2014 this means even the most robust bot built on the GPT API would typically require heavy human supervision. Related: Tech giant Alibaba to roll out ChatGPT competitor AI Some clever developers may have discerned a potential method for circumventing these limitations by building applications that take advantage of GPT\u2019s ability to generate code and connect to external sources. We\u2019ve seen our fair share of trading bots , but the goal of these particular apps goes beyond simply automating crypto news aggregation or teaching a machine learning agent how to recognize the dip. AutoGPT , for example, uses GPT-4 to generate code and then exploits GPT-3.5 to create what appears to be a virtual artificial memory space wherein information is combined and shuttled between the two. Another effort, BabyAGI , combines GPT-4 with LangChain, a coding framework, and Pinecone, a vector database, to spawn new agents in order to complete complex tasks without losing focus on the original objective. Both apps could have the potential to serve as the backbone for a multi-agent, fire-and-forget AI application capable of managing a crypto portfolio from top to bottom based on little more than plain language prompting. While it appears neither app was specifically designed with the cryptocurrency market in mind, we\u2019ve spotted several efforts across social media and on GitHub to adapt one or both for autonomous trading. #AutoGPT using #GPT4 finds another article on the Forbes website.

                  "content": "Disgraced Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes has been rebuffed in her attempt to stay out of federal prison while she appeals her conviction for the fraud she committed while overseeing a blood-testing scam that exposed Silicon Valley\u2019s dark side. In an 11-page ruling issued late Monday, U.S. District Judge Edward Davila concluded there wasn\u2019t compelling enough evidence to allow Holmes to remain free on bail while her lawyers try to persuade an appeals court that alleged misconduct during her four-month trial led to an unjust verdict. Advertisement The judge\u2019s decision means Holmes, 39, will have to surrender to authorities April 27 to start the more than 11-year prison sentence that Davila imposed in November. The punishment came 10 months after a jury found her guilty on four counts of fraud and conspiracy against the Thearanos investors who believed in her promises to revolutionize the health care industry. Holmes had accompanied her lawyers to a San Jose, California, courtroom on March 17 to try to convince Davila that various missteps by federal prosecutors, and the omission of key evidence, will culminate in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals exonerating her. Advertisement Holmes\u2019 prison sentence is scheduled to start roughly 20 years after she dropped out of Stanford University when she was 19 years old to start Theranos in Palo Alto, California \u2014 the same city where William Hewlett and David Packard founded a company bearing their surnames in a small garage and planted the seeds of what grew into Silicon Valley. Holmes could still file another appeal of Davila\u2019s latest ruling, a maneuver her co-conspirator at Theranos \u2014 Ramesh \u201cSunny\u201d Balwani \u2014 successfully used to delay his scheduled March 16 date to begin a nearly 13-year prison sentence. But the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals last week rejected that appeal, and Balwani is now scheduled to report to a Southern California prison on April 20. Davila has recommended Holmes serve her sentence in a Bryan, Texas, prison. It hasn\u2019t yet been publicly confirmed if that will be the facility where she reports. Unless she can find a way to stay free, Holmes will be separated from the two children she had leading up to the trial and after her conviction. Her first child, a boy, was born shortly before her trial began in September 2021. The youngest child, whose gender hasn\u2019t been disclosed in court documents, was born at some point after her November sentencing. She conceived both with her current partner, William \u201cBilly\u201d Evans, whom she met after breaking up with Balwani in the midst of Theranos\u2019 downfall. The denial of Holmes\u2019 request to remain free is the latest twist in a long-running saga that has already been the subject of an acclaimed HBO documentary and an award-winning Hulu TV series. Although they had separate trials, Holmes and Balwani were accused of essentially the same crimes centered on a ruse touting Theranos\u2019 blood-testing system as a breakthrough in health care. The claims helped the company become a Silicon Valley sensation that raised nearly $1 billion from investors and at one point anointed Holmes with a $4.5 billion fortune, based on her 50% stake in Theranos. Holmes also parlayed the buzz surrounding Theranos to speaking engagements on the same stage as former President Bill Clinton and glowing cover stories in business publications that likened her to tech visionaries such as Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Advertisement But Theranos\u2019 technology never came close to working like Holmes and Balwani boasted, resulting in the company\u2019s scandalous collapse and a criminal case that shined a bright light on Silicon Valley greed and hubris.",

                  "content": "Five years after the once highflying Chicago tech company Outcome Health began to unravel, a jury has found all three of its former leaders guilty of multiple counts of fraud , while acquitting them of several other counts. The jury deliberated for about two days before reaching its verdict Tuesday morning. The verdict followed a 10-week-long trial . Advertisement Jury members found Outcome co-founder and former CEO Rishi Shah guilty on 19 of 22 counts. They found co-founder and former President Shradha Agarwal guilty on 15 of 17 counts. The jury found Brad Purdy, the company\u2019s former chief operating officer and chief financial officer, guilty on 13 of 15 counts. Advertisement Some of the counts carry sentences of up to 30 years in prison. Any prison time will be decided during sentencing, but that hearing date has not yet been set. The verdict represented a stunning fall for the three who were once young stars of Chicago\u2019s tech scene. And it may have implications for others in the tech community, with parts of the case focusing on the line between startups\u2019 typical growing pains and fraud. A spokesperson for Shah, now 37, said that he hopes to appeal. \u201cToday\u2019s verdict deeply saddens Mr. Shah, and he will exhaust every avenue to overturn this result,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday. Theodore Poulos, an attorney for Purdy, 33, said in a statement Tuesday: \u201cWe are profoundly disappointed with the jury\u2019s verdict in this complex and nuanced case, particularly given the plethora of evidence adduced at trial, which showed that certain critical information was intentionally withheld from Brad Purdy. \u201cRegretfully, throughout his tenure at Outcome Health, he trusted and believed in his colleagues and failed to ask the questions that a more seasoned executive might have asked,\u201d Poulos said. \u201cBrad is an extremely honorable and intelligent young man and I have no doubt that he will be a very valuable member of the business world in the future, having learned very hard and costly lessons about that world in this case.\u201d Lawyers for Agarwal, 37, declined to comment Tuesday. Former Outcome Health President Shradha Agarwal, center left, leaves following the guilty verdict in the criminal fraud trial at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse, on April 11, 2023. (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) Outcome sold advertising to pharmaceutical companies, with the ads running on TVs and tablets that Outcome installed in doctors\u2019 offices and waiting rooms. During the trial, prosecutors alleged that Shah, Agarwal and Purdy lied about how many doctors\u2019 offices had screens and tablets running their content. Prosecutors said they then used those false numbers to overcharge drug companies for advertising, and inflated revenue figures used to get loans and raise money from investors. Advertisement Over the years, Outcome was able to raise nearly $1 billion from lenders and high-profile investors, including a fund co-founded by Gov. J.B. Pritzker and units of Goldman Sachs and Google. In 2011, Outcome had only 16 employees, but by 2017, the company had grown to more than 500 employees and had a reported valuation of more than $5 billion. That breakneck growth earned Outcome\u2019s founders Shah and Agarwal respect and riches. Shah, who owned 80% of Outcome, was named to the Forbes 400 ranking of richest Americans in 2017, with a net worth of $3.6 billion at the age of 31. Agarwal owned 20% of the company. Their success, however, began to crumble when a former Outcome analyst contacted the Wall Street Journal, which then ran a 2017 article revealing the alleged problems at Outcome. The company lost business, investors sued and Shah and Agarwal stepped down. In 2019, Outcome, as a company, agreed to pay $70 million to pharmaceutical companies to resolve a federal fraud investigation. The criminal fraud trial that just concluded focused on Outcome\u2019s three top executives as individuals. Throughout the case, defense attorneys placed the blame entirely on a fourth former Outcome employee, Ashik Desai . Desai had already pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud before the trial, and he testified that he falsified screen shots and return-on-investment reports without his bosses\u2019 knowledge. As part of an agreement with the government, Desai could get a reduced prison sentence for his testimony. Defense attorneys argued that the defendants trusted Desai, and he repeatedly reassured them that everything was aboveboard whenever questions arose. They argued that Desai was a master con man, who lied to his bosses to further his own career and feed his ego. Advertisement \u201cHe just lies and lies and lies,\u201d Poulos said of Desai during the trial. \u201cThat is his essence.\u201d Government prosecutors tried to poke holes in the theory that Desai acted without his bosses\u2019 knowledge by showing communications between the defendants, and, in some cases, Desai, in an attempt to demonstrate that they were aware of underdeliveries to clients and wanted to fire workers who raised concerns. Prosecutor Matthew Madden ridiculed the idea that Desai, who joined the company when he was 20 years old, was a criminal mastermind capable of completely deceiving his bosses. \u201cThe defendants were the CEO, the president and COO/CFO, the top three executives at the company,\u201d Madden told jurors during the trial. \u201cThey ran that business day-in and day-out for years, yet the lawyers have portrayed them as if they were truly clueless about the business they created and ran. ... It is laughable for them to suggest that Ashik outsmarted them.\u201d It was a complex case that featured about 1,500 exhibits, many in the forms of emails, documents, texts and voice messages. A number of the fraud counts on which the three were convicted were related to checks Outcome accepted for drug companies\u2019 advertisements despite not playing the drug companies\u2019 ads on enough screens. Others were related to money Outcome accepted from banks and investors after providing them with \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d information, according to prosecutors. Advertisement Shah and Agarwal were also convicted on a handful of counts having to do with an episode in which a newly hired executive left the company after only three weeks in 2017, after becoming concerned with Outcome\u2019s business practices. When the executive started raising concerns, Shah and Agarwal exchanged communications about whether to fire him and other employees who had tipped him off. Defense attorneys had argued that Shah and Agarwal were concerned that the executive didn\u2019t fit the company\u2019s culture, and had been reassured by Desai that nothing was amiss. The jury also found Shah guilty of two money laundering counts related to $450,000 that prosecutors said he spent to lease a Chicago home, and $65,000 he spent to hire a private jet for a weekend trip. Prosecutors said those dollars were proceeds of the bank fraud. Throughout the case, prosecutors argued that Outcome leaders believed it was acceptable for startups to fudge numbers and clean up later. It\u2019s an issue that has gained national attention in recent years after the fraud conviction of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, and legal actions surrounding the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Prosecutors highlighted a 2017 voice message from Shah to Purdy, regarding problems with affidavits, return-on-investment reports and forecasting at Outcome. \u201cIf you talk to people who were at Google or Facebook from, you know a hundred million to a billion (dollars), they will tell you these are normal things,\u201d Shah said. \u201cGoogle data was false and totally crazy in foreign markets in the early years.\u201d Advertisement Desai also said during his testimony that Shah had told him it was normal for startups to have \u201cmessy kitchens.\u201d The verdict Tuesday is a reminder that startups must follow the law, said Ira Weiss, a clinical professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, who was not involved in the trial. \u201cThere are limits to \u2018fake it til you make it,\u2019 \u201d Weiss said in an email after the verdict. \u201cOutcome Health had clearly gotten to the point where they had \u2018made it,\u2019 and once you get to that point, you must stop faking it.\u201d Shah\u2019s attorney, John Hueston, argued during the trial that Outcome was \u201cmaking it until Desai arrived and began faking it,\u201d while prosecutors alleged that Outcome had long been engaging in fraud. \u201cEven when they wanted to turn the corner and embark on making it, they knew that the truth about their fraud-filled growth could not see the light of day, not if they wanted to get $1 billion from their lenders and investors,\u201d prosecutor William Johnston said during the trial. Though they were criminally convicted Tuesday, Shah, Agarwal and Purdy still face charges from a civil lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over the fraud allegations. Two other former Outcome employees, Kathryn Choi, a former senior analyst, and Oliver Han, a former analyst, also previously both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and have not yet been sentenced.

                  "content": "Executives at the stablecoin issuer Circle and the bankrupt cryptocurrency lender BlockFi have been questioned by two members of Congress investigating the so-called \u201cmutual backscratching arrangements\u201d alleged to have taken place with the now-failed Silicon Valley Bank. On April 9, letters from Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) were sent to Circle, BlockFi and 12 other non-crypto tech firms asking a series of questions on each firm\u2019s relationship with SVB. The lawmakers stated that more needs to be known about SVB\u2019s reported \u201ccoddling\u201d and \u201cwhite glove\u201d treatment towards its largest depositors in order to understand if these firms played a role in SVB\u2019s collapse. Jeremy Allaire and Zac Prince, the respective chief executives of Circle and BlockFi, were questioned on the length of their financial relationships with SVB and t amounts deposited with the bank, along with what \u201cagreements\u201d were made between their firms. In addition, the pair wanted to know if SVB offered \u201cperks\u201d such as low-interest rate mortgages or SVB-sponsored \u201cski trips, conferences and fancy dinners.\u201d \u201cCongress, bank regulators, and the public are owed an explanation for the bank\u2019s hyper-reliance on tech industry firms and investors,\" Warren and AOC wrote. Related: Polls suggest Elizabeth Warren\u2019s anti-crypto army strategy won\u2019t pay off They added the extent of SVB\u2019s depositors in the tech industry resulted \u201cin an abnormally high percentage of deposits\u201d not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and questioned the executives on \u201cthe role that companies like yours might have played in precipitating the $42 billion single-day-run on SVB.\u201d \u201cObtaining information on these factors is important for understanding how SVB failed and how to prevent the next failure,\u201d they added. Warren and AOC said they believe it may explain why some customers, such as Circle, placed extremely large amounts of uninsured deposits at SVB. Shortly after SVB collapsed, Circle disclosed that it had $3.3 billion tied up at SVB , while BlockFi was found to have $227 million in uninsured deposits with the bank.

                  "content": "Executives at the stablecoin issuer Circle and the bankrupt cryptocurrency lender BlockFi have been questioned by two members of Congress investigating the so-called \u201cmutual backscratching arrangements\u201d alleged to have taken place with the now-failed Silicon Valley Bank. On April 9, letters from Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) were sent to Circle, BlockFi and 12 other non-crypto tech firms asking a series of questions on each firm\u2019s relationship with SVB. The lawmakers stated that more needs to be known about SVB\u2019s reported \u201ccoddling\u201d and \u201cwhite glove\u201d treatment towards its largest depositors in order to understand if these firms played a role in SVB\u2019s collapse. Jeremy Allaire and Zac Prince, the respective chief executives of Circle and BlockFi, were questioned on the length of their financial relationships with SVB and t amounts deposited with the bank, along with what \u201cagreements\u201d were made between their firms. In addition, the pair wanted to know if SVB offered \u201cperks\u201d such as low-interest rate mortgages or SVB-sponsored \u201cski trips, conferences and fancy dinners.\u201d \u201cCongress, bank regulators, and the public are owed an explanation for the bank\u2019s hyper-reliance on tech industry firms and investors,\" Warren and AOC wrote. Related: Polls suggest Elizabeth Warren\u2019s anti-crypto army strategy won\u2019t pay off They added the extent of SVB\u2019s depositors in the tech industry resulted \u201cin an abnormally high percentage of deposits\u201d not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and questioned the executives on \u201cthe role that companies like yours might have played in precipitating the $42 billion single-day-run on SVB.\u201d \u201cObtaining information on these factors is important for understanding how SVB failed and how to prevent the next failure,\u201d they added. Warren and AOC said they believe it may explain why some customers, such as Circle, placed extremely large amounts of uninsured deposits at SVB. Shortly after SVB collapsed, Circle disclosed that it had $3.3 billion tied up at SVB , while BlockFi was found to have $227 million in uninsured deposits with the bank.
