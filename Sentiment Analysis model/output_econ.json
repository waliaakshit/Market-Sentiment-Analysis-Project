The Tracking Indexes for the Global Economic Recovery (TIGER) is also featured in the Financial Times. A version of this article will appear in Project Syndicate. The latest update of the Brookings-FT TIGER indexes (Tracking Indexes for the Global Economic Recovery) underscores a perilous moment for the world economy, with persistently high inflation, banking sector turmoil, and geopolitical risks threatening to derail growth. There are a few bright spots, with China and India, in particular, likely to register strong growth. The proliferation of risks on multiple fronts and the tightening of financial conditions are taking a toll on household and business confidence and are likely to impinge negatively on medium-term growth. Eswar Prasad Senior Fellow - Global Economy and Development Twitter EswarSPrasad Aryan Khanna Student - Cornell University Caroline Smiltneks Student - Cornell University Inflation in the major economies is likely to have peaked as supply constraints ease, demand weakens, and some transitory factors such as last year\u2019s spike in energy prices wane. Still, the persistence of inflation above targets leaves many central bankers with little choice but to continue tightening, even if less aggressively than before. In a few major advanced economies including the United States, banking sector turmoil is putting central bankers in a greater quandary. Private sector confidence has taken a hit and, with financial conditions tightening, could constrain investment and therefore GDP growth beyond this year. Learn more about the recovery in advanced and emerging markets (PDF) Greece Ireland Netherlands Portugal South Korea Country Composite Index Advanced Economy Emerging Market Economy Euro Periphery Economy Euro Periphery / Advanced Economy Indexes constructed by Eswar Prasad, Aryan Khanna (Cornell), and Caroline Smiltneks (Cornell), The Brookings Institution, April 2023 The U.S. economy continues its surprising run despite numerous headwinds, with employment and consumption demand still growing robustly. Banking system stresses portend further troubles ahead. Even if these are brought under control quickly, however, there could be a hit to business and consumer confidence, which remain fragile. This could dampen private sector investment, in particular. With inflation expectations easing, a softish landing is not out of the question but depends on how quickly the Federal Reserve tries to push inflation toward its target while seeking to limit banking distress. The looming debt ceiling stalemate could disrupt financial markets and growth, with repercussions for the entire world economy. The eurozone and the United Kingdom seem to have gotten past the worst of their woes although significant growth is hardly assured. Mild temperatures and moderating energy prices helped both economies power through a difficult winter, but high inflation remains a constraint on policies, while ambiguity about the direction of policies adds uncertainty in itself. In Japan, both domestic demand and exports remain feeble. If above-target inflation proves persistent, the Bank of Japan could face pressure to reverse yield curve control and negative policy rates, which have kept the yen weak and provided limited support to domestic demand. The major emerging market economies have held up quite well, despite some of them experiencing high inflation and weakening currencies relative to the dollar. The overall resilience of emerging markets is a testament to their inherent dynamism, improvements in policy frameworks, and reduced vulnerability to external shocks on account of lower levels of foreign currency external debt and sizable foreign exchange reserves. Low-income and frontier economies are suffering the most on account of rising external debt service costs, weak export demand, and limited domestic policy space.

The government has enough room on macroeconomic policies to hit the target of about 5 percent if growth momentum weakens. After a turbulent year, the property market is still beset by price declines, which could hurt growth through both household demand and investment channels. Continuity at the helms of major economic and financial agencies constitutes a positive omen of the government\u2019s intention to support growth with suitable policy measures and at least limited reforms. But these appointments will not dispel concerns about a renewed emphasis on a state-dominated economy, with the private sector under increasingly tight control. India is poised for another year of strong growth, with reforms undertaken in previous years paying off, although domestic demand is showing signs of waning momentum. The room for monetary policy maneuver is limited by high (but declining) inflation, and the government has reoriented some expenditures to support demand while aiming for fiscal discipline. Private investment is constrained by a still lengthy and incomplete reform agenda as well as a banking system burdened by nonperforming loans. Brazil and Russia are likely to register at best modest growth, weighed down by various domestic and external factors. The Brazilian government\u2019s attacks on the central bank could damage the economy and roil financial markets. Russia\u2019s economy, which was flailing last year due to sanctions and the disruptive effects of its invasion of Ukraine, seems to have stabilized. A number of middle- and low-income economies with high levels of foreign currency debt and large current account deficits, such as Ghana and Sri Lanka, are vulnerable to tightening conditions in global financial markets. Erratic domestic policies in countries such as Turkey and Venezuela are exacerbating their frailties. A stronger dollar, fueled by further U.S. rate hikes and perhaps also a flight to safety if turmoil continues, could add to these pressures. With global demand weak, currency depreciation and stronger exports will not cushion these economies. Policymakers, especially central bankers, are floundering as they hit the limits of their tools in an environment of rapidly multiplying risks. Their actions are keeping growth from collapsing but also exposing the frailties of financial systems in the major economies and adding to concerns about medium-term growth. More fundamental supply-side, labor market, and financial reforms that generate higher productivity growth remain the best path to rebuild private sector confidence and enhance durable growth.

                  "content": "Amid the Collapse of Three U.S. Banks, Is the U.S. Petrodollar Facing the Same Fate? by Cameron Keegan April 9, 2023, 02:27 29 Views 5 Votes Considering the recent turmoil in the U.S. banking system, the trajectory of the global power of the U.S. dollar comes under scrutiny, as too, the economy of our entire country. In the past year, the upper echelons within the Western oil and gas industry have been observing a shift in global energy markets toward China, Russia and India. Indeed, amid the deepening conflict and escalating uncertainties between Ukraine and Russia, we have witnessed Western sanctions against Russia, and China and India\u2019s willingness to secure energy supplies at \u201cenormous discounts\u201d from the successor state to the former Soviet Union. However, might closer economic relations between Russia, and China and India\u2014but particularly China\u2014signal a trajectory in falling dominance for the U.S. dollar, which could profoundly impact the U.S. energy markets? To explore this wavering concern, let us firstly open a brief chapter in history. The U.S. dollar reigns supreme Before the onset of the 20th century, the value of a currency was pegged to the value of gold. As a result, a bank would have been limited by its gold reserves when providing a loan. Then, the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944 established a system where gold became the basis for the U.S. dollar, and consequently, other currencies were tied to the U.S. dollar\u2019s value\u2014those of 44 allied nations to be precise. But the Bretton Woods system formally ended in 1971 when U.S. President Richard Nixon announced that America would no longer exchange gold for U.S. currency, thus taking the country off the gold standard. Afterwards, the U.S. dollar spiralled into depreciation, but the sale of U.S. oil played an essential role in bolstering its value. In 1974, the Nixon administration cut a deal with Saudi Arabia, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Essentially, the Saudis would designate their crude oil sales in U.S. dollars and obtain American military supplies and equipment. Thus, consistent demand for the U.S. was ensured, especially as other OPEC members negotiated similar deals; hence the term \u201cpetrodollar\u201d was coined to denote U.S. dollars exchanged for crude oil exports. To this very day, the petrodollar still rules\u2014 yet, for how long though? Russia and China strike a closer economic relationship But the era where the U.S. dollar dominates has been in question year after year, not least due to increasing competition from China, which boasts the world\u2019s second-largest economy , the largest consumer of most commodities , and now, its expanding economic relationship with Russia\u2014more specifically, in guzzling up the Great Bear\u2019s crude oil at 40 percent discount . Indeed, by June 2022, China\u2019s spending on Russian energy had escalated to $25 billion since the warfare between Ukraine and Russia began in February, almost double the value of the same period in 2021. Since sanctions were placed by Western powers on Russia, be it the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union, Russia has been looking to the East to secure long-term sales in the energy market, particularly its largest export\u2014crude oil. As a result, its former Cold War rival, China, snapped up a record quantity of Russian crude oil in May 2022, raising purchases to $7.47 billion, about $1 billion more than the previous month and double that in 2021. Furthermore, Russia\u2019s state-owned energy operator Gazprom agreed to a 30-year contract with China National Petroleum Corporation in February 2022, with 10 billion cubic meters of annual gas set to flow through a new pipeline in the next few years. And in September 2022, the two state-owned energy giants agreed to use Russian roubles and Chinese yuan to pay for Russian gas supplies to China. How could this increasingly cozy economic relationship between China and Russia effect the value of the U.S. dollar? Impact on the U.S. dollar Suppose Russia and China are to continue trading crude oil in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. With China now the world\u2019s largest oil importer, what would be the trajectory of the dominance of the petrodollar\u2014and thus power for the U.S. alone? Furthermore, central banks worldwide are increasingly keen to hold China\u2019s yuan as a reserve currency. According to the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) Asset Management\u2019s annual reserve manager survey of June 2022, around 85 percent of central banks said they are invested or are considering investing in the yuan\u2014that\u2019s an increase of 81 percent compared to 2021. Moreover, the UBS report estimates that reserve managers at central banks, on average, are seeking to hold 5.8 percent of their reserves in China\u2019s currency in a decade, a sharp increase from the 2.8 percent level reported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in late December 2022. According to the IMF , as central banks look to diversify their holdings, the U.S. dollar\u2019s dominance has been dented due to a quarter of reserve managers turning to the Chinese yuan and three-quarters exploring currencies from nations that typically play limited roles as reserve assets. Furthermore, this major financial agency of the United Nations adds that: \u201cA characterization of the evolution of the international reserve system in the last 20 years is thus as ongoing movement away from the dollar, a recent if still modest rise in the role of the renminbi [Chinese yuan], and changes in market liquidity, relative returns and reserve management enhancing the attractions of nontraditional reserve currencies. These observations provide hints of how the international system may evolve going forward.\u201d Though the U.S. dollar remains the world\u2019s most prominent reserve currency, with central banks holding around 59 percent of their reserves in the dollar, for China to continue pushing the yuan to take on a more significant share of the global reserve currency, how will the U.S. ensure the top spot in the long term? Yet, despite the significance of the U.S. dollar in the global markets and despite the dollar being its strongest in two decades , it is ranked as the 9th strongest currency . In contrast, the Kuwaiti dinar has secured the top spot, while the British pound sterling and the Euro hold the 6th and 8th position, respectively. Historically, the U.S. dollar reached an all-time high in February 1985\u2014before a dramatic plunge by December 1987. Since then, the dollar has experienced steady waves. Thus far, the Chinese yuan hasn\u2019t made the top ten. But no doubt the Red Dragon is eager to rise and boost its currency. So how will the U.S. manage Chinese competition and retain the value of its greenbacks in the long term? While the strength of the dollar is holding\u2014albeit wavering\u2014it is still holding. But, now, how do we explain the latest debacle with three U.S. banks hitting rock bottom within days of each other? Three U.S. banks collapse within days On Sunday, March 12, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), U.S. Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a joint statement about New York City\u2019s Signature Bank\u2014that this leading institution in cryptocurrency lending \u201cclosed today by its state chartering authority.\u201d The statement went on to explain they would make a \u201csystemic risk exception\u201d for Signature and Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), a bank focused on the tech and startup sector that was also shut down , allowing both banks\u2019 clients to have full access to their deposits. They added that: \u201cAs with the resolution of [SVB], no losses will be borne by the taxpayer. Shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders will not be protected. Senior management has also been removed. Any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund to support uninsured depositors will be recovered by a special assessment on banks, as required by law.\u201d Signature served as one of the leading banks in the cryptocurrency industry\u2014the largest alongside Silvergate, which also announced its impending liquidation on March 8. As of December 31, 2022, Signature had $110.4 billion in total assets and $88.6 billion in total deposits, according to a securities filing. By March 10, it had a market value of $4.4 billion after a 40 percent sell-off this year, according to FactSet . While the go-to bank for tech startups, SVB, collapsed on March 10, Signature also saw its shares plunge following deposit outflows. New York state officials reportedly said closing the bank was made \u201c in light of market events \u201d to protect the bank\u2019s clients and prevent spreading the crisis throughout the financial system. Let us pause and recollect a series of extraordinary banking failures. First, California-based, crypto-focused Silvergate announced its upcoming liquidation. Second, SVB imploded only two days later, the largest U.S. bank collapse since the financial crisis of 2008. Third, Signature drowned another two days later. Yet despite sparked concerns, with many top lenders seeing their stocks plunge , President Joe Biden reassured Americans that the U.S. banking system is \u201csafe.\u201d President Biden says \u201cthe banking system is safe\u201d \u201cYour deposits are safe,\u201d Biden said in a March 13 set of remarks from the Roosevelt Room at the White House. \u201cLet me also assure you we will not stop at this. We will do whatever is needed on top of all this.\u201d By law, up to $250,000 is insured for each depositor\u2019s account in each bank. Still, the Biden administration and the Fed have announced they will make funding available to refund the startups and tech companies impacted by the bank closures. Biden had also noted in a March 12 statement on his administration\u2019s action to protect depositors at both banks, expressing he would hold those responsible for \u201cthis mess\u201d accountable for their actions. Indeed, the statement articulated that: \u201cOver the weekend, and at my direction, [Treasury Secretary Janet] Yellen and my National Economic Council Director worked with banking regulators to address problems at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. I am pleased that they reached a prompt solution that protects American workers and small businesses, and keeps our financial system safe. The solution also ensures that taxpayer dollars are not put at risk.\u201d This \u201cfunding\u201d to refund depositors from the Deposit Insurance Fund is financed primarily by the fees charged to banks after assessment, which can be traced to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 , following the Great Depression to protect depositors when their banks collapsed. \u201cManagement of these banks will be fired. If the bank is taken over by FDIC, the people running the bank should not work there anymore,\u201d Biden continued in his set of remarks, adding that investors would \u201cnot be protected\u201d because they were aware of the risks involved. U.S. bank stocks fall, and another 50 U.S. banks could fail While President Biden, a.k.a. \u201cGrandpa Joe,\u201d aimed to provide Americans with peace of mind about the state of the U.S. banking system, reports revealed that major U.S. bank stocks, including Western Alliance Bancorporation, Charles Schwab Corp., First Republic Bank and PacWest Bancorp dropped considerably in the pre-market trading hours on that very same day. Furthermore, according to former vice-president at Lehman Brothers Lawrence McDonald, another 50 U.S. regional lenders could fail amid rising banking uncertainty unless a \u201cstructural problem\u201d is fixed. The collapse of Lehman Brothers marked the beginning of the global financial crisis in 2008, in which the financial markets seized up and restrained international banks from obtaining U.S. dollars. During an interview with Russian news outlet RIA Novosti, McDonald accused the Fed and its Chairman Jerome Powell of having a lack of understanding over the risk of constant rate hikes for U.S. regional banks. Indeed, the Fed raised interest rates by 0.25 percent, the ninth increase in a year, attempting to counterbalance rising inflation with the latest turmoil in the banking system. McDonald went on to say: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be further damage. They [the Fed] have to cut rates and then they have to have a deposit guarantee, a larger one, that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to come up with\u2026 That\u2019s a bailout . That\u2019s basically the federal government taking on bank deposit risk.\u201d It could be argued that the Fed\u2019s decision to pump $2.3 trillion into the U.S. economy during the coronavirus lockdown might have been channelled into firms like SVB, which invested in the tech industry and created overvalued stock, and falsely inflated prices. Furthermore, this injection of trillions of dollars that landed in banks might have been invested in \u201csafe assets\u201d like bonds \u2014but those bonds didn\u2019t remain a reliable investment once the Fed began to raise rates, leading to the tumult of three U.S. banks collapsing within days. Well, as of March 16, the Fed announced the launch of an \u201cemergency loan program\u201d to inject funds worth $2 trillion into the U.S. banking system. So that\u2019s just great. No, wait, another 186 banks could fail According to a study , published by the Social Science Research Network on March 24, an additional 186 banks are at risk of collapse\u2014even if 50 percent of their depositors withdraw their funds. The paper, whose authors hail from the University of Southern California, Northwestern University, Columbia University and Stanford University, argues that the Fed\u2019s interest rate hikes to reduce inflation have diminished the value of bank assets such as government bonds , and asset-backed securities such as mortgage-backed securities . The authors conclude that: \u201cIf uninsured deposit withdrawals cause even small fire sales, substantially more banks are at risk. Overall, these calculations suggest that recent declines in bank asset values very significantly increased the fragility of the U.S. banking system to uninsured depositor runs.\u201d On this note, a coalition of midsize U.S. banks has asked regulators to extend FDIC insurance to all deposits for the next two years , asserting that the step is necessary to stabilize the banking sector and avoid a potential crisis. Let us remind ourselves that small and midsize banks account for over 50 percent of commercial and industrial lending, residential real estate lending and commercial real estate lending. If federal regulators do not commit to such an arrangement, a significantly vast amount of money, notwithstanding full authority or power, could be transferred from midsize banks to America\u2019s largest such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup. Midsize bank\u2019s shares fall despite an agreement to gain billions It was widely reported on March 16 that 11 U.S. banks agreed to deposit $30 billion with midsize lender First Republic Bank , probably as an attempt to dampen panic among depositors fleeing regional banks. The lenders said in a statement that regional, midsize and small banks are \u201ccritical to the health and functioning of our financial system.\u201d Bank of America, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Wells Fargo will inject $5 billion each, while Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will deposit $2.5 billion each. In addition, five other banks pledged deposits totaling $5 billion. In another joint statement , Yellen, Powell, FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg and Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu praised the banks\u2019 decision, noting \u201cthe show of support by a group of large banks is most welcome, and demonstrates the resilience of the banking system.\u201d Despite the move from the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks, First Republic struggled, with its shares falling to all time new lows on March 20. It goes without saying that the federal government will attempt to infuse \u201ccalm\u201d into Americans worried about bank deposits\u2014and subsequently, our financial security. According to Sara Devereux, global head of investing giant Vanguard\u2019s fixed-income group, recent events reflect a \u201csentiment contagion\u201d rather than the \u201ctrue systemic contagion\u201d observed during the 2008 financial crisis. Label recent events as you will. But correct predictions have been made; for example, investor Robert Kiyosaki said during a March 14 interview with Fox Business , \u201cI think the next bank to go is Credit Suisse\u2026because the bond market is crashing.\u201d Indeed, by March 16, Credit Suisse became the first major global bank to take up an emergency lifeline ; the investment bank announced it would borrow $54 billion from the Swiss central bank to avert liquidity after its shares and bonds plunged to a record low.

Get Rid of U.S. Dollars Now, Says Peter Schiff Gold bug and economist Peter Schiff has urged U.S. dollar holders to get rid of their USD now. He tweeted Friday: How much clearer does the writing on the wall need to be? Get rid of your U.S. dollars now, while there\u2019s still enough people who still can\u2019t read it. His tweet was prompted by an article titled, \u201cSaudi Arabia, Southeast Asian Nations Swipe Left on US Dollar Dependence,\u201d which highlights the mounting efforts by countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia and ASEAN nations, to reduce their reliance on the U.S. and the dollar.

The best move you can make to mitigate your personal loss is to divest of dollars and dollar-denominated financial assets. The economist has repeatedly issued warnings about the state of the U.S. economy and the looming devaluation of the U.S. dollar. In a recent tweet, he cautioned that the U.S. economy is \u201cpoised on the biggest economic disaster in its history,\u201d emphasizing that we are on the cusp of a financial crisis that will be bigger than the last one.

                  "content": "Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Provides $18 Million to Over a Dozen Higher Education Institutions, Including 7 Minority Serving Institutions, and $54 Million to Train the Next Generation of Clean Energy and Manufacturing Workers WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 As part of President Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda , the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced five competitively selected higher education institutions to serve as Centers of Excellence for DOE\u2019s Industrial Assessment Centers (IAC) Program and will receive a combined $18.7 million in funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Also, DOE today announced a $54 million funding opportunity from the Law to expand the IAC Program to community colleges, trade schools, and union training programs, and create new Building Training and Assessment Centers ( BTACs ) at higher education institutions. Both announcements advance the Department\u2019s mission to streamline the career pipeline for students looking to join the clean energy economy, part of the Biden\u2013Harris Administration\u2019s actions to achieve net-zero emissions no later than 2050 while supporting workers and communities. \u201cStrengthening and diversifying the pipeline for high-quality manufacturing and building efficiency jobs is part of President Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda to create an economy that will allow our nation to reach its clean energy future,\u201d said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. \u201cThis is a direct investment in the next generation of American workers that will help ensure America\u2019s global leadership in advanced manufacturing and green building technologies.\u201d President Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda is growing the American economy from the bottom up and middle-out \u2014 from rebuilding our nation\u2019s infrastructure, to creating a manufacturing and innovation boom powered by good-paying jobs that don\u2019t require a four-year degree, to building a clean-energy economy that will combat climate change and make our communities more resilient. IAC Regional Centers of Excellence Selectees DOE\u2019s Industrial Assessment Centers (IAC) Over more than four decades, the IAC Program has provided more than 20,000 assessments at small- and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs), which comprise more than 90% of the nation\u2019s manufacturing base. IACs typically identify more than $130,000 in potential annual savings opportunities for every manufacturer assessed. Today, DOE-supported IACs exist at 37 universities in 28 states across the country, with 17 of those institutions having participated in a pilot to provide similar assessments to small and medium-sized commercial buildings. The new Regional Centers of Excellence will enhance and expand the IAC Program by serving as regional hubs for the program that collaborate and coordinate with government, nonprofit, labor, and industry actors to train clean energy workers and support small- and medium-sized manufacturers in each respective regions. Two of the five selectees, and seven of the partnering institutions, are Minority-Serving Institutions (MSI). Each of the selectees will bring unique capabilities in strengthening the IAC network: Great Plains Center of Excellence at Oklahoma State University (Stillwater, OK), in partnership with Northern Oklahoma College, Wichita State University, and the University of Nebraska, will advance the IAC network\u2019s use of technology-driven assessments \u2014 including through use of mobile applications, drones, and virtual/augmented reality. This center will also deepen the IAC network\u2019s partnerships with community colleges and Tribal communities. Southeastern Center of Excellence at Georgia Tech University (Atlanta, GA), in partnership with Clark Atlanta University, Florida A&M University, and Kennesaw State University, will draw on these universities\u2019 internationally renowned expertise in energy management, industrial electrification, and complex assessments. Mid-Atlantic Center of Excellence at Lehigh University (Bethlehem, PA), in partnership with West Virginia University, will expand the IAC network\u2019s engagement with unions, trade schools, and community colleges, and develop new assessment methodologies to better serve small manufacturers. Gulf Coast Center of Excellence at Texas A&M University (College Station, TX), a national leader in remote and hybrid assessments, will accelerate the IAC network\u2019s growing emphasis on industrial decarbonization, electrification, and resiliency planning. Western Center of Excellence at San Francisco State University (San Francisco, CA), in partnership with San Jose State University, San Diego State University, Laney College, and Cuyamaca College \u2014 a group of five leading minority-serving institutions \u2014 will apply their expertise in data-driven tracking to evaluate and improve manufacturer performance, renewable energy, energy demand management, thermal systems design, and waste and water management to enhance manufacturing competitiveness across the Western U.S. Learn more about each selection here . Funding Opportunity Announcement : $54 Million to Expand IACs and Create BTACs The new IACs and BTACs that will be created with this funding will build upon the demonstrated success of applied learning environments and hands-on training approaches of existing IACs. The IACs also will draw on the unique strengths, geographic reach, and faculty/student composition of trade schools, community colleges, union training programs, and other institutions of higher education. The new IACs will focus on high-quality skilled trades job pathways in fields, such as industrial electrician, energy management, renewable energy , and advanced manufacturing, while providing hands-on support to small and medium manufactures. The new BTACs will expand these benefits to commercial and institutional buildings to help lower utility costs and allow companies to reinvest in businesses, employees, and community services. The BTACs will train engineers, architects, building scientists, building energy permitting and enforcement officials, and building technicians in energy-efficient building design and operation. The IAC and BTAC programs will provide services in historically underserved communities and support DOE\u2019s work toward honoring the President\u2019s Justice40 Initiative. An informational webinar on the funding opportunity will be held on April 18, 2023 at 2:00 p.m. ET. Concept papers are required and are due on May 25, 2023 at 5 p.m. ET, with full applications due on July 31, 2023 at 5 p.m. ET. DOE\u2019s Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC) manages the IAC Program, and the Office of State and Community Energy Programs (SCEP) manages the BTAC Program.

                  "content": "Todd Groth Todd Groth is Head of Index Research at CoinDesk Indices. . He has over 10 years of experience involving systematic multi-asset risk premia and alternative investment strategies. Follow @ tgroth8 on Twitter It\u2019s been quite a start to the year in the world of crypto. Bitcoin ( BTC ) posted its best quarterly performance in over two years, gaining 68%, for the first three months of 2023. The broader CoinDesk Market Index, or CMI \u2013 which spans over 90% of the crypto market capitalization \u2013 is up 58% on the quarter with ether ( ETH ) and cardano ( ADA ) up 50% and 57% over the same period. Todd Groth is head of research at CoinDesk Indices , a provider of digital asset indices since 2014. The computing sector, or CPU (+67%), benefited from the positive sentiment surrounding artificial intelligence sparked by the the debut of ChatGPT last November. The currency sector, or CCY (+63%), benefited from the U.S. regional bank jitters and from the expansion across central bank balance sheets. January\u2019s rebound in investor sentiment (see \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d) has provided buoyancy for the broad market after a challenging 2022. Digitization, or BTZ (+24%), and DeFi, or DCF (+43%), are also positive for the year. Figure 1: CMI Sector 2023 Performance Attribution; Source: CDI Research Digital assets tend to do best when they trade according to their own narrative (say like bitcoin\u2019s inflation hedge thesis) and decouple from the factors and themes driving traditional asset classes. So far in 2023, crypto appears to be bucking trends driving stocks and bonds, including 2022 inflation fears and quantitative-tightening at the Federal Reserve. Digital assets have less in common now with growth-oriented equities, with a lowering of correlation between digital assets and equities. Within bitcoin specifically, we're also seeing a strengthening in the correlation with gold (positive) and the U.S. dollar (negative). The \u201cdigital gold\u201d and fiat \u201ccurrency debasement hedge\u201d narratives re-emerge and regain investor consideration. Figure 2: One-hour correlations between bitcoin (XBX) vs macro indexes. Source: CDI Research Bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed partly to the steepening of the yield curve in the bond market. We continue to see a moderately negative relationship between bitcoin price changes and the yield curve slope (using the five-year to the 30-year yield spread as proxies), which is a market-derived proxy for interest-rate expectations based on U.S. Treasury bond pricing. The recent peak in U.S. yield curve inversion of +46 basis points on March 8, just before the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, tumbled to -15 basis points as of March 27 as the market priced in fewer rate hikes and cuts post-SVB. This 60 basis-point drop in yield curve slope (with five-year rates dropping more than 30-year rates, bull steeping), combined with the negative correlation of -0.4 between the yield curve slope and bitcoin, suggests one-third of bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed to the steepening of the yield curve. This relationship between bitcoin and the yield curve strengthened during the Silicon Valley Bank event, supporting the digital gold narrative. With the Federal Reserve's balance sheet continuing to expand, in a mere two weeks the new lending facilities created to mitigate the regional banking crisis in March have undone months of balance sheet tightening. The Fed\u2019s actions come alongside continued monetary stimulus coming from the Bank of Japan (buying domestic bonds to maintain yield curve control) and the People\u2019s Bank of China, which is stimulating an economy weakened by COVID lockdowns. From the perspective of a digitally scarce asset like bitcoin, these are all encouraging developments. But it\u2019s unlikely we are heading for a halcyon redux of 2021\u2019s crypto bull market The U.S. regional banking concerns and the rapid unwind of Credit Suisse (CS) have highlighted weaknesses in the traditional financial system when interest rates rise. While this may come to the delight or amusement of crypto maximalists and critics of the fractionalized banking system, it is a source for further deleveraging contagion risk. Most digital-asset investments share a broader portfolio with traditional public and private-asset markets, with capital allocation decisions within these portfolios linking these disparate markets together through relative value choices which promote and drive correlations across markets. Crypto cannot sail alone. That the Fed will make fewer hikes, and more rate cuts, is pretty much priced into the market now and reflected in the yield curve steepening mentioned above. That has benefited bitcoin and gold, and at the expense of the U.S. dollar. A portion of these rate expectations might be due to the move of investors out of banking deposits and into front-end Treasurys for corporate treasury risk-management purposes. Why hold deposits at a regional bank, when you can earn similar interest in short-term paper without the credit risk of a potentially shaky bank? That said, the market appears to view the collapse of SVB as a pivot in the interest-rate hiking cycle. If the tightening of credit conditions and lending standards begin to percolate through the economy and inflation cools down further, then the Federal Reserve will no longer have to hike rates as the credit markets have effectively tightened financial conditions on the Fed\u2019s behalf. But if inflation remains persistent and elevated, the Fed will have to go against market pricing and continue to hike, which has the potential of triggering a redux of 2013's \"Taper Tantrum\" and the liquidation risk mentioned above. Liquidity in crypto markets has dropped with trading volumes post-FTX. Until prices rise enough to reignite interest from traders who exited the market in 2022, we don't expect it to improve. With U.S. regulatory action against exchanges and the closure of a number of banks providing crypto on-ramping services, additional hurdles remain for capital entering into the digital-asset market these days.

                  "description": "ALSO: Sam Reynolds writes that former BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes foresees the balkanization of finance and bitcoin rallying because the current global banking system \"is bankrupt.\" Bitcoin is on the rise.",
                  "content": "James Rubin James Rubin is CoinDesk's U.S. news editor based on the West Coast. Follow @ @JPRubin23 on Twitter Good morning. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening: Prices: Bitcoin and ether are well within the green as they near highs not seen since the Covid-induced bull market. Insights: For former BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes, traditional banking is broken and finance will never be the same. Bitcoin and ether are well within the green as the Asia business day begins, with bitcoin pushing past a yearly high of $30,000, and ether beginning to test $2,000. Crypto-related stocks are also at year-long highs as the price of bitcoin surges. While bitcoin's relationship to the current banking crisis has made it a clear winner over the last month, there are plenty of questions as to how the Ethereum network's Shanghai upgrade is going to impact the price of ether. Is it what ether needs to surge ahead? Or, is ether just following bitcoin's gains? Ether Capital CEO Brian Mosoff calls it a \"non-event.\" \u201cMy suspicion is that this is going to be a non-event in terms of price,\u201d Mosoff told CoinDesk TV\u2019s \u201cFirst Mover\u201d on Monday . \u201cI expect you will see more ETH get locked into staking, either from solo stakers or, again, you\u2019ll see more structured products come to market.\u201d There's also the fact that most of the staked ether is also being held at a loss, as CryptoQuant recently wrote in a report. Meanwhile, the futures market is pricing in modest gains for ether on contracts that expire at the end of June. New inflation data is scheduled to be released on April 12, which should show that the Fed has tamed the beast, and that's always been bullish for crypto and risk assets. Although some have said that there's a new safe haven narrative forming around crypto , the data still shows a tight correlation between it and the S&P 500. \"We are likely to see continued accumulation from longer-term investors interested in its currency debasement hedge properties, while short-term moves are dictated by shifting theories about what monetary liquidity will do,\" Noelle Acheson, the author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, recently wrote. Arthur Hayes Isn't Mincing Words About Banking During the coldest days of 2022\u2019s crypto winter, when the wreckage of FTX was still smoldering, VanEck forecast that bitcoin could drop to $10K-$12K by the first quarter of 2023. \"Bitcoin will test $10,000-$12,000 in Q1 amid a wave of miner bankruptcies, which will mark the low point of the crypto winter,\" Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, wrote at the time. In many ways VanEck was right about the pressure bitcoin has been under: some miners have gone bankrupt , others are engaged in litigation with each other and mining-friendly Texas has passed legislation limiting the benefits available to the industry. But VanEck was wrong about something major: the price of bitcoin. 2023 has been defined by being a mini-bull market. Year-to-date, bitcoin is up about 80%, currently just over $30K. And that\u2019s all in the face of crypto-friendly banks Silvergate and Signature collapse. \"It's all driven by the collapsing of the Western banking system,\" Arthur Hayes said in a recent interview with CoinDesk. \u201cThe world is recognizing the entire Western banking system is bankrupt, and they\u2019re all f\u2014ed.\u201d Bitcoin's correlation with traditional assets is breaking as it serves as an asset outside the traditional fiat banking system, Hayes says, pointing to the S&P 500\u2019s 7% gain year-to-date, versus bitcoin\u2019s more than 80% increase. And what does the Hayes portfolio look like as the Western banking system teeters? Bitcoin, gold, property and maybe even some assets in RMB. \u201cI\u2019m going to go into all these other things that are not connected to the banking system directly,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to own assets in Dubai and all these other regions that actually have a real economy other than just printing money.\u201d Hayes isn\u2019t a total dollar doomer \u2013 his prediction is that it's still going to be in use with the U.S. and her allies, but it will no longer be the world\u2019s reserve currency. The next decade will see the balkanization of currencies, with the dollar making up 40-50% of trade (between 1999-2019 it accounted for 74% of Asia-Pacific trade , and 96% of trade in the Americas). \u201cThe West will be a dollar block, and other non-aligned countries will use gold, Dirhams, CNY, rubles, whatever,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you go to different places you\u2019ll need to use a different currency, and everyone becomes an FX speculator more than they are today.\u201d What about the price of bitcoin? In March, Balaji Srinivasan bet that bitcoin would be $1 million by June 17 on the back of hyperinflation and a failing banking system. On Twitter, he continues to double down on the prediction though prediction markets are giving it a 99% chance of not happening. Hayes doesn\u2019t discount the possibility of bitcoin hitting $1 million, and has been a vocal supporter of Srinivasan on Twitter. But it might not happen for a while. \u201cI know it\u2019s coming, and I think bitcoin just keeps climbing. Will it reach $70,000 this year? I doubt it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2024 there will be the halving, and more banks that have gone bankrupt in the U.S. and Europe. You\u2019ll probably also have a very explicit guarantee of all deposits in the Western world by central banks.\u201d At this point, Hayes argues, the market will know it needs to be in bitcoin, gold, ether, or other assets. \u201cAnything that isn\u2019t stocks and government bonds,\u201d he says.

The resolution will be proposed at the JPMorgan Chase Annual General Meeting on May 16.\"JPMorgan Chase must stop pumping money into an industry that is driving the climate crisis,\" said Kathy Mulvey, director of the Climate Accountability Campaign at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). \"As people around the world face climate-related extreme weather disasters, threats to public health, and systemic economic risk, big banks are choosing to ignore climate science by providing billions of dollars in financing to fossil fuel companies that continue to expand their production of oil and gas. JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions are continuing to mislead shareholders about what is needed to reach global climate goals and instead seeking to maintain a dangerous status quo that prioritizes profit over people and the environment.\"\"To safeguard communities, investors, and the global economy, shareholders should insist that banks incentivize swift and deep cuts in heat-trapping emissions to limit climate change harms and facilitate a just transition to a clean energy economy,\" Mulvey added.The letter was led by prominent scientists Dr. Pep Canadell (Executive Director, Global Carbon Project, CSIRO, Australia), Dr. Rachel Cleetus (Union of Concerned Scientists), Joel Clement (Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School), Dr. Brenda Ekwurzel (Union of Concerned Scientists), Dr. Peter Gleick (Member, US National Academy of Sciences and MacArthur Fellow), Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson (Urban Ocean Lab), Dr. Sarah E.

UCS and the Adrian Dominican Sisters filed the letter as an with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \"Instead of continuing on the current path Starbucks has taken, we urge you to create and build a healthy working relationship with unionized partners.\" A progressive coalition representing 62 million people and nearly 500 member organizations on Tuesday urged new Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan to end the coffee giant's hostility toward unioned workers and organizers across the United States. Since workers in Buffalo, New York a historic election to form Starbucks' first U.S. union in December 2021, employees at hundreds of locations throughout the nation have started organizing\u2014and have been met with union-busting tactics from the company. Ahead of Schultz's testimony, the HELP Committee a report pointing to dozens of National Labor Relations Board complaints against Starbucks and explaining that \"though the coffee giant claims they are a 'progressive' company, there is mounting evidence that the $113 billion-dollar company's anti-union efforts include a pattern of flagrant violations of federal labor law.\" In their Tuesday , civil rights, environmental, gender justice, and labor groups wrote to Narasimhan, \"It's our hope that you uphold Starbucks' reputation as an inclusive and welcoming for the community by taking this opportunity to redefine the company's relationship with Starbucks partners working in cafes, reserve stores, and roasteries across the country.\" \"While our organizations represent many facets of the progressive movement, we know our fights are inextricably linked to that of Starbucks Workers United.\" \"We stand by workers exercising their fundamental and constitutional right to form a union,\" the progressive coalition emphasized. \"Freedom of association is a constitutional right, and by joining together to bargain collectively with employers, unions give workers the opportunity to have their voices heard and help make decisions to make meaningful changes in their workplaces.\" \"Unions are good for workers, businesses, our economy, and our democracy,\" the coalition continued. \"They are vehicles that advance equity across class, race, sexual orientation, gender, and immigration status. While our organizations represent many facets of the progressive movement, we know our fights are inextricably linked to that of . We cannot have justice\u2014racial, gender, immigrant, climate\u2014without economic justice.\" The letter concludes by highlighting how Narasimhan can chart a new path: \"Instead of continuing on the current path Starbucks has taken, we urge you to create and build a healthy working relationship with unionized partners. We encourage you to affirm workers' legal right to organize a union by signing the and by committing to bargain in good faith with over 7,500 workers who have formed Starbucks Workers United.\" Signatories include the AFL-CIO, American Federation of Teachers, Communications Workers of America, Community Change Action, Center for Popular Democracy, Greenpeace, MoveOn, National Education Association, People's Action, , Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Sierra Club, Sunrise Movement, UltraViolet, United We Dream, and Women's March. \"Starbucks has repeatedly, shamelessly, and illegally stood in the way of partners who are demanding a voice in their workplace and a strong contract to build a better future for themselves and their families,\" said SEIU international president Mary Kay Henry. \"Narasimhan has an opportunity to stop the company's unprecedented, unpopular campaign of union-busting and instead partner with its workers and their union to build a Starbucks that truly lives up to its stated progressive values.\" \u2014 Fight For 15 (@Fight For 15) AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler pointed out that \"Starbucks has always referred to its employees as partners\" and \"under new leadership, the company now has the chance to treat its workers like partners.\" Community Change president Dorian Warren noted that Narasimhan could \"set a powerful example for corporate America by committing to bargain in good faith with the thousands of workers who make his company's success possible.\" \"The importance of organizing can never be overstated,\" Warren added. \"We are proud to support the Starbucks workers who are forming unions, and asking for higher wages, better benefits, and more control over their workplace conditions. We cannot forget that unions are one of the most important tools we have to protect and strengthen our democracy and build equity for all.\" Group leaders also stressed that they represent millions of members and massive movements that support unionization efforts at Starbucks. \"Women's March unites with Starbucks workers\u2014a workforce that is more than 70% women and women of color\u2014as they organize tirelessly to take on the challenges they face in their workplace,\" said executive director Rachel Carmona. \"This is not just a matter of fairness and justice\u2014but a women's rights issue.\" MoveOn executive director Rahna Epting declared that \"Starbucks' record to date on unions has been distasteful, disrespectful, and disingenuous.\" \"Millions of members of MoveOn support workers' rights and want Starbucks to do right by the people who work for your company,\" she told the new CEO. \"Your partners should be able to exercise their rights to freely and fairly organize and negotiate over their working conditions without fear of retaliation.\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ron Wyden urged the administration to ignore the order, calling it a dangerous abuse of power. The Biden White House on Monday said it would not simply ignore a Trump-appointed judge's ruling that could imperil access to a safe abortion medication, dismissing a demand from progressive lawmakers who characterized the decision as a flagrant abuse of judicial power with far-reaching implications. \"No,\" an unnamed White House spokesperson when asked whether it would instruct the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ignore the right-wing judge's ruling invalidating the agency's decades-old approval of mifepristone, which is typically used as to end a pregnancy. \"We stand by FDA's approval of mifepristone, and we are prepared for a long legal fight, if needed,\" the spokesperson continued. \"The focus of the administration is on ensuring that we prevail in the courts. There is a process in place for appealing this decision and we will pursue that process vigorously and do everything we can to prevail in the courts.\" During a briefing on Monday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that \"we are going to always follow the law\" after a reporter asked whether the administration intends to comply with Kacsmaryk's order. \"Doesn't mean that we're not going to fight,\" she added. The White House's adherence to business-as-usual legal procedure comes even as top Biden administration officials acknowledged that, should U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk's ruling be upheld, the entire FDA approval process could be thrown into chaos and placed at the mercy of far-right judges. \"You're not talking about just mifepristone,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra on Sunday. \"You're talking about every kind of drug. You're talking about our vaccines. You're talking about insulin. You're talking about the new Alzheimer's drugs that may come on.\" \"The courts are now going rogue with rulings that no longer even pretend to respect precedent, jurisprudence, or limits to overreach.\" The U.S. Justice Department formally appealed the Texas judge's unilateral ruling on Monday as legal analysts and rights groups grappled with the decision's glaring flaws and potentially profound impacts on abortion rights and other freedoms. \"His order, which applies nationwide, marks the first time in history that a court has claimed the authority to single-handedly pull a drug from the market, a power that courts ,\" court writer Mark Joseph Stern shortly after the ruling was made public Friday evening. \"Kacsmaryk's ruling is indefensible from top to bottom and will go down in history as one of the judiciary's most shocking and lawless moments,\" Stern argued. \"Within an hour of its release, the decision also spurred the start of a constitutional crisis: A federal judge in Washington swiftly issued a dueling injunction compelling the FDA to continue allowing mifepristone in 17 states and the District of Columbia, which brought a separate suit in Washington.\" In a late Friday , Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) characterized Kacsmaryk's ruling as a product of the far right's \"dangerous and undemocratic takeover of our country's institutions\" and said the FDA would be well within its legal authority to ignore it. \"The FDA, doctors, and pharmacies can and must go about their jobs like nothing has changed and keep mifepristone accessible to women across America,\" said Wyden, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee. \"If they don't, the consequences of banning the most common method of abortion in every single state will be devastating.\" Rep. (D-N.Y.) issued a similar call and warned that the failure to resist out-of-control judges \"paves a dangerous road of worsening abuse of power.\" \"The courts are now going rogue with rulings that no longer even pretend to respect precedent, jurisprudence, or limits to overreach,\" the New York Democrat wrote. \"They are long overdue for a check and balance.\" \u2014 (@Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) Even one Republican\u2014Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina\u2014said the FDA should ignore the Texas judge's ruling after one of her GOP colleagues for the agency if it does so. \"This is an FDA-approved drug,\" Mace said in a appearance on Monday. \"Whether you agree with its usage or not, that's not your decision. That is the FDA's decision.\" \u2014 Kaitlan Collins (@Kaitlan Collins) Kacsmaryk's order is set to take effect this coming Friday barring an intervention from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is hearing the Biden administration's legal challenge. The Justice Department, which called the ruling \"extraordinary and unprecedented,\" has requested that the order be put on hold as the legal process plays out. Given the right-wing bent of the fifth circuit, which includes , the chances that Kacsmaryk's order will be upheld appear strong\u2014meaning the case could be on a path to the conservative-dominated U.S. Supreme Court. \"Only the Supreme Court can resolve this looming crisis, and it has a very limited window of time in which to do so,\" Stern last week. \"It has been less than a year since the court claimed to rid itself of the abortion issue. Now it must decide whether American patients will lose access to an abortion drug that has been on the market for 23 years and proven safer than Tylenol\u2014on the order of a single, rogue judge.\" \"After years of David Malpass in the president's office, we cannot afford another second of climate denial leading the bank,\" said one campaigner. Roughly 100 activists marked the opening day of the World Bank Group spring by riding bicycles through the streets of Washington, D.C. on Monday night, calling on incoming bank president Ajay Banga to halt fossil fuel financing and ramp up clean energy and climate justice investments. While demanding a turnaround on green funding in developing countries, the \"Wrong Way on Climate\" bike protest blocked rush-hour traffic outside World Bank headquarters as finance ministers traveled to dinner parties and backroom meetings. \"Bikes are very literally people-powered,\" Hope Neyer, a public health student and organizer with Shutdown D.C., said in a statement. \"They're the ultimate zero-emission vehicles. We chose to gather on bikes tonight to remind the World Bank of the potential we have as individuals and communities to show up for what we believe in\u2014the need to protect our planet, the international right to make healthy choices for our families, and a future that is just and livable for us all.\" The action took place on the first day of the bank's 2023 spring meetings, which are being run this week by outgoing World Bank President David Malpass. Climate advocates in February when Malpass, tapped to lead the bank by then-U.S. President Donald Trump in 2019, said that he plans to step down by the end of June, nearly a year ahead of schedule. The early resignation announcement a sustained against Malpass, who was condemned as a \"climate denier\" after to acknowledge that burning fossil fuels causes the planet-heating pollution underlying increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather disasters around the globe. Activists\u2014whose bike ride started under a banner that reads, \"World Bank: Time for a Fresh Start on Climate\"\u2014are now looking to Malpass' replacement, Banga, to reverse course and scale up decarbonization efforts. Progressives in February U.S. President Joe Biden for nominating the private equity executive and former Mastercard CEO to the role, arguing that he's likely to advance the powerful international financial institution's historically pro-corporate and pro-fossil fuel agenda. Campaigners are wasting no time in pressuring Banga to make the World Bank an instrument for genuinely sustainable development. \"Nominee Banga has the opportunity of a lifetime, if he can rise to the climate challenge.\" \"After years of David Malpass in the president's office, we cannot afford another second of climate denial leading the bank,\" Andrew Nazdin, director of the Glasgow Actions Team, said Monday. \"Nominee Banga has the opportunity of a lifetime, if he can rise to the climate challenge\u2014ending financing oil or gas, ramping up investment in renewables, and becoming the transformative leader the world is begging for.\" In an attempt to defend his record amid criticism last September, Malpass said the World Bank allocated $31.7 billion to climate finance in 2021, with half of it aimed at bolstering adaptation efforts. Not only is that a tiny fraction of the trillions of dollars in green investment the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is needed each year to maintain a habitable planet, but according to by the , Malpass was directly involved in weakening multilateral development banks' (MDBs) joint announcement on climate lending at COP26. After the World Bank itself last year as \"the of climate investments in developing countries,\" Bronwen Tucker of Oil Change International that \"the World Bank Group still funds more fossil fuels than any other MDB, and they continue to lock Global South countries into expensive and volatile fossil fuel contracts through their heavy-handed policy lending programs.\" The Big Shift Global coalition in a recent report that the World Bank has directly financed at least $14.8 billion in fossil fuel production since the signing of the Paris agreement in 2015\u2014negating its 2017 to stop supporting oil and gas projects within two years. The IPCC and the International Energy Agency have that fossil fuel expansion is with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above preindustrial levels, beyond which the climate emergency's consequences will even deadlier, especially for humanity's poorest members who have done the least to cause the crisis. \u2014 The Big Shift Global (@The Big Shift Global) \"As the World Bank and IMF meet behind closed doors to advance the agenda of concentrated corporate and political power, a coalition of D.C.-area activists in solidarity with movements worldwide, especially in the Global South, manifested a very different vision outside,\" Basav Sen, member of the For People For Planet coalition, said Monday. \"We encircled the meetings on bicycle and on foot, to assert the power of organized people.\" Concerned citizens from around the globe are demonstrating throughout the week to demand that the World Bank stop financing fossil fuels. They also plan to call for an overhaul of both Bretton Woods institutions\u2014the World Bank and the \u2014to \"prioritize justice, helping developing countries to green to follow a 1.5\u00b0C roadmap with poverty alleviation at its heart,\" according to the Glasgow Actions Team. \"They will also call to end the 'gentlemen's agreement' that has thus far allowed only the U.S. to nominate the World Bank president.\" On Tuesday morning, activists held a \"First 100 Days\" protest outside World Bank headquarters. They unveiled a first 100 days checklist that outlines what they want incoming bank president Banga to achieve at the start of his five-year term. Campaigners also plan to gather outside the World Bank on Wednesday for a \"Stop Fossil Gas\" demonstration, where they will draw attention to the bank's continued funding of a worldwide expansion of gas pipelines. Activists plan to cap off the week of action with a large march and rally on Friday that features a \"Trojan Horse\" of debt impacts on low-income nations the World Bank works with.",

Digitization, or BTZ (+24%), and DeFi, or DCF (+43%), are also positive for the year. Figure 1: CMI Sector 2023 Performance Attribution; Source: CDI Research Digital assets tend to do best when they trade according to their own narrative (say like bitcoin\u2019s inflation hedge thesis) and decouple from the factors and themes driving traditional asset classes. So far in 2023, crypto appears to be bucking trends driving stocks and bonds, including 2022 inflation fears and quantitative-tightening at the Federal Reserve. Digital assets have less in common now with growth-oriented equities, with a lowering of correlation between digital assets and equities. Within bitcoin specifically, we're also seeing a strengthening in the correlation with gold (positive) and the U.S. dollar (negative). The \u201cdigital gold\u201d and fiat \u201ccurrency debasement hedge\u201d narratives re-emerge and regain investor consideration. Figure 2: One-hour correlations between bitcoin (XBX) vs macro indexes. Source: CDI Research Bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed partly to the steepening of the yield curve in the bond market. We continue to see a moderately negative relationship between bitcoin price changes and the yield curve slope (using the five-year to the 30-year yield spread as proxies), which is a market-derived proxy for interest-rate expectations based on U.S. Treasury bond pricing. The recent peak in U.S. yield curve inversion of +46 basis points on March 8, just before the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, tumbled to -15 basis points as of March 27 as the market priced in fewer rate hikes and cuts post-SVB. This 60 basis-point drop in yield curve slope (with five-year rates dropping more than 30-year rates, bull steeping), combined with the negative correlation of -0.4 between the yield curve slope and bitcoin, suggests one-third of bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed to the steepening of the yield curve. This relationship between bitcoin and the yield curve strengthened during the Silicon Valley Bank event, supporting the digital gold narrative. With the Federal Reserve's balance sheet continuing to expand, in a mere two weeks the new lending facilities created to mitigate the regional banking crisis in March have undone months of balance sheet tightening. The Fed\u2019s actions come alongside continued monetary stimulus coming from the Bank of Japan (buying domestic bonds to maintain yield curve control) and the People\u2019s Bank of China, which is stimulating an economy weakened by COVID lockdowns. From the perspective of a digitally scarce asset like bitcoin, these are all encouraging developments. But it\u2019s unlikely we are heading for a halcyon redux of 2021\u2019s crypto bull market The U.S. regional banking concerns and the rapid unwind of Credit Suisse (CS) have highlighted weaknesses in the traditional financial system when interest rates rise. While this may come to the delight or amusement of crypto maximalists and critics of the fractionalized banking system, it is a source for further deleveraging contagion risk. Most digital-asset investments share a broader portfolio with traditional public and private-asset markets, with capital allocation decisions within these portfolios linking these disparate markets together through relative value choices which promote and drive correlations across markets. Crypto cannot sail alone. That the Fed will make fewer hikes, and more rate cuts, is pretty much priced into the market now and reflected in the yield curve steepening mentioned above. That has benefited bitcoin and gold, and at the expense of the U.S. dollar. A portion of these rate expectations might be due to the move of investors out of banking deposits and into front-end Treasurys for corporate treasury risk-management purposes. Why hold deposits at a regional bank, when you can earn similar interest in short-term paper without the credit risk of a potentially shaky bank? That said, the market appears to view the collapse of SVB as a pivot in the interest-rate hiking cycle. If the tightening of credit conditions and lending standards begin to percolate through the economy and inflation cools down further, then the Federal Reserve will no longer have to hike rates as the credit markets have effectively tightened financial conditions on the Fed\u2019s behalf. But if inflation remains persistent and elevated, the Fed will have to go against market pricing and continue to hike, which has the potential of triggering a redux of 2013's \"Taper Tantrum\" and the liquidation risk mentioned above. Liquidity in crypto markets has dropped with trading volumes post-FTX. Until prices rise enough to reignite interest from traders who exited the market in 2022, we don't expect it to improve. With U.S. regulatory action against exchanges and the closure of a number of banks providing crypto on-ramping services, additional hurdles remain for capital entering into the digital-asset market these days.

                  "description": "ALSO: Sam Reynolds writes that former BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes foresees the balkanization of finance and bitcoin rallying because the current global banking system \"is bankrupt.\" Bitcoin is on the rise.",
                  "content": "James Rubin James Rubin is CoinDesk's U.S. news editor based on the West Coast. Follow @ @JPRubin23 on Twitter Good morning. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening: Prices: Bitcoin and ether are well within the green as they near highs not seen since the Covid-induced bull market. Insights: For former BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes, traditional banking is broken and finance will never be the same. Bitcoin and ether are well within the green as the Asia business day begins, with bitcoin pushing past a yearly high of $30,000, and ether beginning to test $2,000. Crypto-related stocks are also at year-long highs as the price of bitcoin surges. While bitcoin's relationship to the current banking crisis has made it a clear winner over the last month, there are plenty of questions as to how the Ethereum network's Shanghai upgrade is going to impact the price of ether. Is it what ether needs to surge ahead? Or, is ether just following bitcoin's gains? Ether Capital CEO Brian Mosoff calls it a \"non-event.\" \u201cMy suspicion is that this is going to be a non-event in terms of price,\u201d Mosoff told CoinDesk TV\u2019s \u201cFirst Mover\u201d on Monday . \u201cI expect you will see more ETH get locked into staking, either from solo stakers or, again, you\u2019ll see more structured products come to market.\u201d There's also the fact that most of the staked ether is also being held at a loss, as CryptoQuant recently wrote in a report. Meanwhile, the futures market is pricing in modest gains for ether on contracts that expire at the end of June. New inflation data is scheduled to be released on April 12, which should show that the Fed has tamed the beast, and that's always been bullish for crypto and risk assets. Although some have said that there's a new safe haven narrative forming around crypto , the data still shows a tight correlation between it and the S&P 500. \"We are likely to see continued accumulation from longer-term investors interested in its currency debasement hedge properties, while short-term moves are dictated by shifting theories about what monetary liquidity will do,\" Noelle Acheson, the author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, recently wrote. Arthur Hayes Isn't Mincing Words About Banking During the coldest days of 2022\u2019s crypto winter, when the wreckage of FTX was still smoldering, VanEck forecast that bitcoin could drop to $10K-$12K by the first quarter of 2023. \"Bitcoin will test $10,000-$12,000 in Q1 amid a wave of miner bankruptcies, which will mark the low point of the crypto winter,\" Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, wrote at the time. In many ways VanEck was right about the pressure bitcoin has been under: some miners have gone bankrupt , others are engaged in litigation with each other and mining-friendly Texas has passed legislation limiting the benefits available to the industry. But VanEck was wrong about something major: the price of bitcoin. 2023 has been defined by being a mini-bull market. Year-to-date, bitcoin is up about 80%, currently just over $30K. And that\u2019s all in the face of crypto-friendly banks Silvergate and Signature collapse. \"It's all driven by the collapsing of the Western banking system,\" Arthur Hayes said in a recent interview with CoinDesk. \u201cThe world is recognizing the entire Western banking system is bankrupt, and they\u2019re all f\u2014ed.\u201d Bitcoin's correlation with traditional assets is breaking as it serves as an asset outside the traditional fiat banking system, Hayes says, pointing to the S&P 500\u2019s 7% gain year-to-date, versus bitcoin\u2019s more than 80% increase. And what does the Hayes portfolio look like as the Western banking system teeters? Bitcoin, gold, property and maybe even some assets in RMB. \u201cI\u2019m going to go into all these other things that are not connected to the banking system directly,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to own assets in Dubai and all these other regions that actually have a real economy other than just printing money.\u201d Hayes isn\u2019t a total dollar doomer \u2013 his prediction is that it's still going to be in use with the U.S. and her allies, but it will no longer be the world\u2019s reserve currency. The next decade will see the balkanization of currencies, with the dollar making up 40-50% of trade (between 1999-2019 it accounted for 74% of Asia-Pacific trade , and 96% of trade in the Americas). \u201cThe West will be a dollar block, and other non-aligned countries will use gold, Dirhams, CNY, rubles, whatever,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you go to different places you\u2019ll need to use a different currency, and everyone becomes an FX speculator more than they are today.\u201d What about the price of bitcoin? In March, Balaji Srinivasan bet that bitcoin would be $1 million by June 17 on the back of hyperinflation and a failing banking system. On Twitter, he continues to double down on the prediction though prediction markets are giving it a 99% chance of not happening. Hayes doesn\u2019t discount the possibility of bitcoin hitting $1 million, and has been a vocal supporter of Srinivasan on Twitter. But it might not happen for a while. \u201cI know it\u2019s coming, and I think bitcoin just keeps climbing. Will it reach $70,000 this year? I doubt it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2024 there will be the halving, and more banks that have gone bankrupt in the U.S. and Europe. You\u2019ll probably also have a very explicit guarantee of all deposits in the Western world by central banks.\u201d At this point, Hayes argues, the market will know it needs to be in bitcoin, gold, ether, or other assets. \u201cAnything that isn\u2019t stocks and government bonds,\u201d he says.

In virtually all cities, fire departments operate as a public service financed by local government, usually via property taxes. But if you call 911 for an ambulance, you could face a huge bill, even for a short ride. Ambulances typically don't operate as a free public service. In many states the average balance due runs over $1,000. Having health insurance does help, but deductibles and exclusions can still leave you with a huge bill. A medical emergency that requires an ambulance can easily drive you into debt. People sometimes beg not to be put in ambulances, even in situations where they clearly need them. One Boston resident, her gashed leg caught between a subway train and the platform, pleaded with worried fellow passengers to forego any call to an ambulance service. \"I have terrible health insurance,\" she explained. But things could be worse. Imagine if we had privatized fire departments. We would then see a \"fire-fighting insurance industry\" emerge. Your insurer would receive a bill from the fire-fighting company that put out your fire. These bills would be high, in part because fire companies would have trouble getting poor people to pay them. You would also likely have a giant deductible, and that would leave fires, even for the insured, extremely costly. Many people would become reluctant to call for help. They would try instead to put fires out by themselves, making desperate cost-benefit analyses in a moment of extreme stress instead of just calling the fire department to get their fire extinguished quickly and safely. A privatized fire-fighting system would create ludicrous situations. Saner voices would quickly demand that we return to public fire departments and have everyone, once again, get their fires extinguished for free. Some among us, of course, would likely protest against \"creating\" still another \"costly\" public service. They would lodge against public fire departments the standard conservative arguments against left-leaning health care plans. So you actually trust, these critics would argue, the government to put out your fires? People deserve a choice about how to finance extinguishing the flames that are burning down their houses. And many people like their private fire insurance. You want to take it away from them! You want to eliminate jobs in the private firefighting insurance industry? You want to raise taxes and hurt the economy? Tax-funded fire departments, the argument would continue, put us on a slippery slope to collectivism. My own belief? Ambulances should be close to free, with perhaps a $50 fee to prevent over-use.

The resolution will be proposed at the JPMorgan Chase Annual General Meeting on May 16.\"JPMorgan Chase must stop pumping money into an industry that is driving the climate crisis,\" said Kathy Mulvey, director of the Climate Accountability Campaign at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). \"As people around the world face climate-related extreme weather disasters, threats to public health, and systemic economic risk, big banks are choosing to ignore climate science by providing billions of dollars in financing to fossil fuel companies that continue to expand their production of oil and gas. JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions are continuing to mislead shareholders about what is needed to reach global climate goals and instead seeking to maintain a dangerous status quo that prioritizes profit over people and the environment.\"\"To safeguard communities, investors, and the global economy, shareholders should insist that banks incentivize swift and deep cuts in heat-trapping emissions to limit climate change harms and facilitate a just transition to a clean energy economy,\" Mulvey added.The letter was led by prominent scientists Dr. Pep Canadell (Executive Director, Global Carbon Project, CSIRO, Australia), Dr. Rachel Cleetus (Union of Concerned Scientists), Joel Clement (Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School), Dr. Brenda Ekwurzel (Union of Concerned Scientists), Dr. Peter Gleick (Member, US National Academy of Sciences and MacArthur Fellow), Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson (Urban Ocean Lab), Dr. Sarah E.

By ending support for fossil fuel expansion, it could help set the global stage for a just transition to a more sustainable and livable future while acting decisively to protect its shareholders and the wider economy from the financial shocks associated with worsening climate change,\" the scientists write in the letter. \"This is no less than what science requires to keep our planet a livable place for current and future generations, including our children and grandchildren.\"\"To avoid the most dangerous levels of planetary warming, we must rapidly end our reliance on fossil fuels and transition to a clean energy economy that meets the needs of all communities,\" said Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, co-founder of Urban Ocean Lab and a lead signer on the letter. \"Meanwhile, financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase are funding continued expansion of the fossil fuel industry, even as all the warning signs for our planet are flashing red.

As the scientists point out in their letter, JPMorgan Chase has recklessly provided more than $382 billion in financing for fossil fuel companies since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015, including $65.44 billion to the top 20 companies engaged in the greatest amount of fossil fuel expansion. Meanwhile, the United States experienced 18 separate major climate- and weather-related disasters in 2022, each of which caused over $1 billion in damage. Many of these disasters\u2014including droughts, wildfires and intensified storms\u2014bear the clear fingerprints of climate change. Altogether the 18 events led to the deaths of 474 people and cost an estimated $165 billion, making 2022 the third most costly year for U.S. weather and climate disasters since 1980.\"The science is clear: in order to reduce emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, fossil fuel expansion must stop now, yet JPMorgan Chase and other big banks like Citi, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America continue to pour money into new oil, gas, and coal,\" said Arielle Swernoff, U.S. Banks Campaign Manager at STMP. \"Over 1,300 scientists have come together to say: enough is enough.

Since workers in Buffalo, New York a historic election to form Starbucks' first U.S. union in December 2021, employees at hundreds of locations throughout the nation have started organizing\u2014and have been met with union-busting tactics from the company. Ahead of Schultz's testimony, the HELP Committee a report pointing to dozens of National Labor Relations Board complaints against Starbucks and explaining that \"though the coffee giant claims they are a 'progressive' company, there is mounting evidence that the $113 billion-dollar company's anti-union efforts include a pattern of flagrant violations of federal labor law.\" In their Tuesday , civil rights, environmental, gender justice, and labor groups wrote to Narasimhan, \"It's our hope that you uphold Starbucks' reputation as an inclusive and welcoming for the community by taking this opportunity to redefine the company's relationship with Starbucks partners working in cafes, reserve stores, and roasteries across the country.\" \"While our organizations represent many facets of the progressive movement, we know our fights are inextricably linked to that of Starbucks Workers United.\" \"We stand by workers exercising their fundamental and constitutional right to form a union,\" the progressive coalition emphasized. \"Freedom of association is a constitutional right, and by joining together to bargain collectively with employers, unions give workers the opportunity to have their voices heard and help make decisions to make meaningful changes in their workplaces.\" \"Unions are good for workers, businesses, our economy, and our democracy,\" the coalition continued. \"They are vehicles that advance equity across class, race, sexual orientation, gender, and immigration status. While our organizations represent many facets of the progressive movement, we know our fights are inextricably linked to that of . We cannot have justice\u2014racial, gender, immigrant, climate\u2014without economic justice.\" The letter concludes by highlighting how Narasimhan can chart a new path: \"Instead of continuing on the current path Starbucks has taken, we urge you to create and build a healthy working relationship with unionized partners. We encourage you to affirm workers' legal right to organize a union by signing the and by committing to bargain in good faith with over 7,500 workers who have formed Starbucks Workers United.\" Signatories include the AFL-CIO, American Federation of Teachers, Communications Workers of America, Community Change Action, Center for Popular Democracy, Greenpeace, MoveOn, National Education Association, People's Action, , Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Sierra Club, Sunrise Movement, UltraViolet, United We Dream, and Women's March. \"Starbucks has repeatedly, shamelessly, and illegally stood in the way of partners who are demanding a voice in their workplace and a strong contract to build a better future for themselves and their families,\" said SEIU international president Mary Kay Henry. \"Narasimhan has an opportunity to stop the company's unprecedented, unpopular campaign of union-busting and instead partner with its workers and their union to build a Starbucks that truly lives up to its stated progressive values.\" \u2014 Fight For 15 (@Fight For 15) AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler pointed out that \"Starbucks has always referred to its employees as partners\" and \"under new leadership, the company now has the chance to treat its workers like partners.\" Community Change president Dorian Warren noted that Narasimhan could \"set a powerful example for corporate America by committing to bargain in good faith with the thousands of workers who make his company's success possible.\" \"The importance of organizing can never be overstated,\" Warren added. \"We are proud to support the Starbucks workers who are forming unions, and asking for higher wages, better benefits, and more control over their workplace conditions. We cannot forget that unions are one of the most important tools we have to protect and strengthen our democracy and build equity for all.\" Group leaders also stressed that they represent millions of members and massive movements that support unionization efforts at Starbucks. \"Women's March unites with Starbucks workers\u2014a workforce that is more than 70% women and women of color\u2014as they organize tirelessly to take on the challenges they face in their workplace,\" said executive director Rachel Carmona. \"This is not just a matter of fairness and justice\u2014but a women's rights issue.\" MoveOn executive director Rahna Epting declared that \"Starbucks' record to date on unions has been distasteful, disrespectful, and disingenuous.\" \"Millions of members of MoveOn support workers' rights and want Starbucks to do right by the people who work for your company,\" she told the new CEO. \"Your partners should be able to exercise their rights to freely and fairly organize and negotiate over their working conditions without fear of retaliation.\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ron Wyden urged the administration to ignore the order, calling it a dangerous abuse of power. The Biden White House on Monday said it would not simply ignore a Trump-appointed judge's ruling that could imperil access to a safe abortion medication, dismissing a demand from progressive lawmakers who characterized the decision as a flagrant abuse of judicial power with far-reaching implications. \"No,\" an unnamed White House spokesperson when asked whether it would instruct the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ignore the right-wing judge's ruling invalidating the agency's decades-old approval of mifepristone, which is typically used as to end a pregnancy. \"We stand by FDA's approval of mifepristone, and we are prepared for a long legal fight, if needed,\" the spokesperson continued. \"The focus of the administration is on ensuring that we prevail in the courts. There is a process in place for appealing this decision and we will pursue that process vigorously and do everything we can to prevail in the courts.\" During a briefing on Monday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that \"we are going to always follow the law\" after a reporter asked whether the administration intends to comply with Kacsmaryk's order. \"Doesn't mean that we're not going to fight,\" she added. The White House's adherence to business-as-usual legal procedure comes even as top Biden administration officials acknowledged that, should U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk's ruling be upheld, the entire FDA approval process could be thrown into chaos and placed at the mercy of far-right judges. \"You're not talking about just mifepristone,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra on Sunday. \"You're talking about every kind of drug. You're talking about our vaccines. You're talking about insulin. You're talking about the new Alzheimer's drugs that may come on.\" \"The courts are now going rogue with rulings that no longer even pretend to respect precedent, jurisprudence, or limits to overreach.\" The U.S. Justice Department formally appealed the Texas judge's unilateral ruling on Monday as legal analysts and rights groups grappled with the decision's glaring flaws and potentially profound impacts on abortion rights and other freedoms. \"His order, which applies nationwide, marks the first time in history that a court has claimed the authority to single-handedly pull a drug from the market, a power that courts ,\" court writer Mark Joseph Stern shortly after the ruling was made public Friday evening. \"Kacsmaryk's ruling is indefensible from top to bottom and will go down in history as one of the judiciary's most shocking and lawless moments,\" Stern argued. \"Within an hour of its release, the decision also spurred the start of a constitutional crisis: A federal judge in Washington swiftly issued a dueling injunction compelling the FDA to continue allowing mifepristone in 17 states and the District of Columbia, which brought a separate suit in Washington.\" In a late Friday , Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) characterized Kacsmaryk's ruling as a product of the far right's \"dangerous and undemocratic takeover of our country's institutions\" and said the FDA would be well within its legal authority to ignore it. \"The FDA, doctors, and pharmacies can and must go about their jobs like nothing has changed and keep mifepristone accessible to women across America,\" said Wyden, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee. \"If they don't, the consequences of banning the most common method of abortion in every single state will be devastating.\" Rep. (D-N.Y.) issued a similar call and warned that the failure to resist out-of-control judges \"paves a dangerous road of worsening abuse of power.\" \"The courts are now going rogue with rulings that no longer even pretend to respect precedent, jurisprudence, or limits to overreach,\" the New York Democrat wrote. \"They are long overdue for a check and balance.\" \u2014 (@Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) Even one Republican\u2014Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina\u2014said the FDA should ignore the Texas judge's ruling after one of her GOP colleagues for the agency if it does so. \"This is an FDA-approved drug,\" Mace said in a appearance on Monday. \"Whether you agree with its usage or not, that's not your decision. That is the FDA's decision.\" \u2014 Kaitlan Collins (@Kaitlan Collins) Kacsmaryk's order is set to take effect this coming Friday barring an intervention from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is hearing the Biden administration's legal challenge. The Justice Department, which called the ruling \"extraordinary and unprecedented,\" has requested that the order be put on hold as the legal process plays out. Given the right-wing bent of the fifth circuit, which includes , the chances that Kacsmaryk's order will be upheld appear strong\u2014meaning the case could be on a path to the conservative-dominated U.S. Supreme Court. \"Only the Supreme Court can resolve this looming crisis, and it has a very limited window of time in which to do so,\" Stern last week. \"It has been less than a year since the court claimed to rid itself of the abortion issue. Now it must decide whether American patients will lose access to an abortion drug that has been on the market for 23 years and proven safer than Tylenol\u2014on the order of a single, rogue judge.\" \"After years of David Malpass in the president's office, we cannot afford another second of climate denial leading the bank,\" said one campaigner. Roughly 100 activists marked the opening day of the World Bank Group spring by riding bicycles through the streets of Washington, D.C. on Monday night, calling on incoming bank president Ajay Banga to halt fossil fuel financing and ramp up clean energy and climate justice investments. While demanding a turnaround on green funding in developing countries, the \"Wrong Way on Climate\" bike protest blocked rush-hour traffic outside World Bank headquarters as finance ministers traveled to dinner parties and backroom meetings. \"Bikes are very literally people-powered,\" Hope Neyer, a public health student and organizer with Shutdown D.C., said in a statement. \"They're the ultimate zero-emission vehicles. We chose to gather on bikes tonight to remind the World Bank of the potential we have as individuals and communities to show up for what we believe in\u2014the need to protect our planet, the international right to make healthy choices for our families, and a future that is just and livable for us all.\" The action took place on the first day of the bank's 2023 spring meetings, which are being run this week by outgoing World Bank President David Malpass. Climate advocates in February when Malpass, tapped to lead the bank by then-U.S. President Donald Trump in 2019, said that he plans to step down by the end of June, nearly a year ahead of schedule. The early resignation announcement a sustained against Malpass, who was condemned as a \"climate denier\" after to acknowledge that burning fossil fuels causes the planet-heating pollution underlying increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather disasters around the globe. Activists\u2014whose bike ride started under a banner that reads, \"World Bank: Time for a Fresh Start on Climate\"\u2014are now looking to Malpass' replacement, Banga, to reverse course and scale up decarbonization efforts. Progressives in February U.S. President Joe Biden for nominating the private equity executive and former Mastercard CEO to the role, arguing that he's likely to advance the powerful international financial institution's historically pro-corporate and pro-fossil fuel agenda. Campaigners are wasting no time in pressuring Banga to make the World Bank an instrument for genuinely sustainable development. \"Nominee Banga has the opportunity of a lifetime, if he can rise to the climate challenge.\" \"After years of David Malpass in the president's office, we cannot afford another second of climate denial leading the bank,\" Andrew Nazdin, director of the Glasgow Actions Team, said Monday. \"Nominee Banga has the opportunity of a lifetime, if he can rise to the climate challenge\u2014ending financing oil or gas, ramping up investment in renewables, and becoming the transformative leader the world is begging for.\" In an attempt to defend his record amid criticism last September, Malpass said the World Bank allocated $31.7 billion to climate finance in 2021, with half of it aimed at bolstering adaptation efforts. Not only is that a tiny fraction of the trillions of dollars in green investment the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is needed each year to maintain a habitable planet, but according to by the , Malpass was directly involved in weakening multilateral development banks' (MDBs) joint announcement on climate lending at COP26. After the World Bank itself last year as \"the of climate investments in developing countries,\" Bronwen Tucker of Oil Change International that \"the World Bank Group still funds more fossil fuels than any other MDB, and they continue to lock Global South countries into expensive and volatile fossil fuel contracts through their heavy-handed policy lending programs.\" The Big Shift Global coalition in a recent report that the World Bank has directly financed at least $14.8 billion in fossil fuel production since the signing of the Paris agreement in 2015\u2014negating its 2017 to stop supporting oil and gas projects within two years. The IPCC and the International Energy Agency have that fossil fuel expansion is with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above preindustrial levels, beyond which the climate emergency's consequences will even deadlier, especially for humanity's poorest members who have done the least to cause the crisis. \u2014 The Big Shift Global (@The Big Shift Global) \"As the World Bank and IMF meet behind closed doors to advance the agenda of concentrated corporate and political power, a coalition of D.C.-area activists in solidarity with movements worldwide, especially in the Global South, manifested a very different vision outside,\" Basav Sen, member of the For People For Planet coalition, said Monday. \"We encircled the meetings on bicycle and on foot, to assert the power of organized people.\" Concerned citizens from around the globe are demonstrating throughout the week to demand that the World Bank stop financing fossil fuels. They also plan to call for an overhaul of both Bretton Woods institutions\u2014the World Bank and the \u2014to \"prioritize justice, helping developing countries to green to follow a 1.5\u00b0C roadmap with poverty alleviation at its heart,\" according to the Glasgow Actions Team. \"They will also call to end the 'gentlemen's agreement' that has thus far allowed only the U.S. to nominate the World Bank president.\" On Tuesday morning, activists held a \"First 100 Days\" protest outside World Bank headquarters. They unveiled a first 100 days checklist that outlines what they want incoming bank president Banga to achieve at the start of his five-year term. Campaigners also plan to gather outside the World Bank on Wednesday for a \"Stop Fossil Gas\" demonstration, where they will draw attention to the bank's continued funding of a worldwide expansion of gas pipelines. Activists plan to cap off the week of action with a large march and rally on Friday that features a \"Trojan Horse\" of debt impacts on low-income nations the World Bank works with.",

                  "content": "Todd Groth Todd Groth is Head of Index Research at CoinDesk Indices. . He has over 10 years of experience involving systematic multi-asset risk premia and alternative investment strategies. Follow @ tgroth8 on Twitter It\u2019s been quite a start to the year in the world of crypto. Bitcoin ( BTC ) posted its best quarterly performance in over two years, gaining 68%, for the first three months of 2023. The broader CoinDesk Market Index, or CMI \u2013 which spans over 90% of the crypto market capitalization \u2013 is up 58% on the quarter with ether ( ETH ) and cardano ( ADA ) up 50% and 57% over the same period. Todd Groth is head of research at CoinDesk Indices , a provider of digital asset indices since 2014. The computing sector, or CPU (+67%), benefited from the positive sentiment surrounding artificial intelligence sparked by the the debut of ChatGPT last November. The currency sector, or CCY (+63%), benefited from the U.S. regional bank jitters and from the expansion across central bank balance sheets. January\u2019s rebound in investor sentiment (see \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d) has provided buoyancy for the broad market after a challenging 2022. Digitization, or BTZ (+24%), and DeFi, or DCF (+43%), are also positive for the year. Figure 1: CMI Sector 2023 Performance Attribution; Source: CDI Research Digital assets tend to do best when they trade according to their own narrative (say like bitcoin\u2019s inflation hedge thesis) and decouple from the factors and themes driving traditional asset classes. So far in 2023, crypto appears to be bucking trends driving stocks and bonds, including 2022 inflation fears and quantitative-tightening at the Federal Reserve. Digital assets have less in common now with growth-oriented equities, with a lowering of correlation between digital assets and equities. Within bitcoin specifically, we're also seeing a strengthening in the correlation with gold (positive) and the U.S. dollar (negative). The \u201cdigital gold\u201d and fiat \u201ccurrency debasement hedge\u201d narratives re-emerge and regain investor consideration. Figure 2: One-hour correlations between bitcoin (XBX) vs macro indexes. Source: CDI Research Bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed partly to the steepening of the yield curve in the bond market. We continue to see a moderately negative relationship between bitcoin price changes and the yield curve slope (using the five-year to the 30-year yield spread as proxies), which is a market-derived proxy for interest-rate expectations based on U.S. Treasury bond pricing. The recent peak in U.S. yield curve inversion of +46 basis points on March 8, just before the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, tumbled to -15 basis points as of March 27 as the market priced in fewer rate hikes and cuts post-SVB. This 60 basis-point drop in yield curve slope (with five-year rates dropping more than 30-year rates, bull steeping), combined with the negative correlation of -0.4 between the yield curve slope and bitcoin, suggests one-third of bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed to the steepening of the yield curve. This relationship between bitcoin and the yield curve strengthened during the Silicon Valley Bank event, supporting the digital gold narrative. With the Federal Reserve's balance sheet continuing to expand, in a mere two weeks the new lending facilities created to mitigate the regional banking crisis in March have undone months of balance sheet tightening. The Fed\u2019s actions come alongside continued monetary stimulus coming from the Bank of Japan (buying domestic bonds to maintain yield curve control) and the People\u2019s Bank of China, which is stimulating an economy weakened by COVID lockdowns. From the perspective of a digitally scarce asset like bitcoin, these are all encouraging developments. But it\u2019s unlikely we are heading for a halcyon redux of 2021\u2019s crypto bull market The U.S. regional banking concerns and the rapid unwind of Credit Suisse (CS) have highlighted weaknesses in the traditional financial system when interest rates rise. While this may come to the delight or amusement of crypto maximalists and critics of the fractionalized banking system, it is a source for further deleveraging contagion risk. Most digital-asset investments share a broader portfolio with traditional public and private-asset markets, with capital allocation decisions within these portfolios linking these disparate markets together through relative value choices which promote and drive correlations across markets. Crypto cannot sail alone. That the Fed will make fewer hikes, and more rate cuts, is pretty much priced into the market now and reflected in the yield curve steepening mentioned above. That has benefited bitcoin and gold, and at the expense of the U.S. dollar. A portion of these rate expectations might be due to the move of investors out of banking deposits and into front-end Treasurys for corporate treasury risk-management purposes. Why hold deposits at a regional bank, when you can earn similar interest in short-term paper without the credit risk of a potentially shaky bank? That said, the market appears to view the collapse of SVB as a pivot in the interest-rate hiking cycle. If the tightening of credit conditions and lending standards begin to percolate through the economy and inflation cools down further, then the Federal Reserve will no longer have to hike rates as the credit markets have effectively tightened financial conditions on the Fed\u2019s behalf. But if inflation remains persistent and elevated, the Fed will have to go against market pricing and continue to hike, which has the potential of triggering a redux of 2013's \"Taper Tantrum\" and the liquidation risk mentioned above. Liquidity in crypto markets has dropped with trading volumes post-FTX. Until prices rise enough to reignite interest from traders who exited the market in 2022, we don't expect it to improve. With U.S. regulatory action against exchanges and the closure of a number of banks providing crypto on-ramping services, additional hurdles remain for capital entering into the digital-asset market these days.

                  "description": "ALSO: Sam Reynolds writes that former BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes foresees the balkanization of finance and bitcoin rallying because the current global banking system \"is bankrupt.\" Bitcoin is on the rise.",
                  "content": "James Rubin James Rubin is CoinDesk's U.S. news editor based on the West Coast. Follow @ @JPRubin23 on Twitter Good morning. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening: Prices: Bitcoin and ether are well within the green as they near highs not seen since the Covid-induced bull market. Insights: For former BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes, traditional banking is broken and finance will never be the same. Bitcoin and ether are well within the green as the Asia business day begins, with bitcoin pushing past a yearly high of $30,000, and ether beginning to test $2,000. Crypto-related stocks are also at year-long highs as the price of bitcoin surges. While bitcoin's relationship to the current banking crisis has made it a clear winner over the last month, there are plenty of questions as to how the Ethereum network's Shanghai upgrade is going to impact the price of ether. Is it what ether needs to surge ahead? Or, is ether just following bitcoin's gains? Ether Capital CEO Brian Mosoff calls it a \"non-event.\" \u201cMy suspicion is that this is going to be a non-event in terms of price,\u201d Mosoff told CoinDesk TV\u2019s \u201cFirst Mover\u201d on Monday . \u201cI expect you will see more ETH get locked into staking, either from solo stakers or, again, you\u2019ll see more structured products come to market.\u201d There's also the fact that most of the staked ether is also being held at a loss, as CryptoQuant recently wrote in a report. Meanwhile, the futures market is pricing in modest gains for ether on contracts that expire at the end of June. New inflation data is scheduled to be released on April 12, which should show that the Fed has tamed the beast, and that's always been bullish for crypto and risk assets. Although some have said that there's a new safe haven narrative forming around crypto , the data still shows a tight correlation between it and the S&P 500. \"We are likely to see continued accumulation from longer-term investors interested in its currency debasement hedge properties, while short-term moves are dictated by shifting theories about what monetary liquidity will do,\" Noelle Acheson, the author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, recently wrote. Arthur Hayes Isn't Mincing Words About Banking During the coldest days of 2022\u2019s crypto winter, when the wreckage of FTX was still smoldering, VanEck forecast that bitcoin could drop to $10K-$12K by the first quarter of 2023. \"Bitcoin will test $10,000-$12,000 in Q1 amid a wave of miner bankruptcies, which will mark the low point of the crypto winter,\" Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, wrote at the time. In many ways VanEck was right about the pressure bitcoin has been under: some miners have gone bankrupt , others are engaged in litigation with each other and mining-friendly Texas has passed legislation limiting the benefits available to the industry. But VanEck was wrong about something major: the price of bitcoin. 2023 has been defined by being a mini-bull market. Year-to-date, bitcoin is up about 80%, currently just over $30K. And that\u2019s all in the face of crypto-friendly banks Silvergate and Signature collapse. \"It's all driven by the collapsing of the Western banking system,\" Arthur Hayes said in a recent interview with CoinDesk. \u201cThe world is recognizing the entire Western banking system is bankrupt, and they\u2019re all f\u2014ed.\u201d Bitcoin's correlation with traditional assets is breaking as it serves as an asset outside the traditional fiat banking system, Hayes says, pointing to the S&P 500\u2019s 7% gain year-to-date, versus bitcoin\u2019s more than 80% increase. And what does the Hayes portfolio look like as the Western banking system teeters? Bitcoin, gold, property and maybe even some assets in RMB. \u201cI\u2019m going to go into all these other things that are not connected to the banking system directly,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to own assets in Dubai and all these other regions that actually have a real economy other than just printing money.\u201d Hayes isn\u2019t a total dollar doomer \u2013 his prediction is that it's still going to be in use with the U.S. and her allies, but it will no longer be the world\u2019s reserve currency. The next decade will see the balkanization of currencies, with the dollar making up 40-50% of trade (between 1999-2019 it accounted for 74% of Asia-Pacific trade , and 96% of trade in the Americas). \u201cThe West will be a dollar block, and other non-aligned countries will use gold, Dirhams, CNY, rubles, whatever,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you go to different places you\u2019ll need to use a different currency, and everyone becomes an FX speculator more than they are today.\u201d What about the price of bitcoin? In March, Balaji Srinivasan bet that bitcoin would be $1 million by June 17 on the back of hyperinflation and a failing banking system. On Twitter, he continues to double down on the prediction though prediction markets are giving it a 99% chance of not happening. Hayes doesn\u2019t discount the possibility of bitcoin hitting $1 million, and has been a vocal supporter of Srinivasan on Twitter. But it might not happen for a while. \u201cI know it\u2019s coming, and I think bitcoin just keeps climbing. Will it reach $70,000 this year? I doubt it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2024 there will be the halving, and more banks that have gone bankrupt in the U.S. and Europe. You\u2019ll probably also have a very explicit guarantee of all deposits in the Western world by central banks.\u201d At this point, Hayes argues, the market will know it needs to be in bitcoin, gold, ether, or other assets. \u201cAnything that isn\u2019t stocks and government bonds,\u201d he says.

A medical emergency that requires an ambulance can easily drive you into debt. People sometimes not to be put in ambulances, even in situations where they clearly need them. One Boston resident, her gashed leg caught between a subway train and the platform, with worried fellow passengers to forego any call to an ambulance service. \"I have terrible health insurance,\" she explained. But things could be worse. Imagine if we had privatized fire departments. We would then see a \"fire-fighting insurance industry\" emerge. Your insurer would receive a bill from the fire-fighting company that put out your fire. These bills would be high, in part because fire companies would have trouble getting poor people to pay them. You would also likely have a giant deductible, and that would leave fires, even for the insured, extremely costly. Many people would become reluctant to call for help. They would try instead to put fires out by themselves, making desperate cost-benefit analyses in a moment of extreme stress instead of just calling the fire department to get their fire extinguished quickly and safely. A privatized fire-fighting system would create ludicrous situations. Saner voices would quickly demand that we return to public fire departments and have everyone, once again, get their fires extinguished for free. Some among us, of course, would likely protest against \"creating\" still another \"costly\" public service. They would lodge against public fire departments the standard conservative arguments against left-leaning health care plans. So you actually trust, these critics would argue, to put out your fires? People deserve about how to finance extinguishing the flames that are burning down their houses. And many people like their private fire insurance. You want to from them! You want to eliminate jobs in the private firefighting insurance industry? You want to raise taxes and hurt the economy? Tax-funded fire departments, the argument would continue, put us on a slippery slope to collectivism. My own belief? Ambulances should be close to free, with perhaps a $50 fee to prevent over-use. Based on three million ambulance rides a year, nationwide, the cost of providing this ambulance access would only take about $4 billion a year in new spending, frankly just a rounding error in federal health budgets.",

UCS and the Adrian Dominican Sisters filed the letter as an with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \"Instead of continuing on the current path Starbucks has taken, we urge you to create and build a healthy working relationship with unionized partners.\" A progressive coalition representing 62 million people and nearly 500 member organizations on Tuesday urged new Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan to end the coffee giant's hostility toward unioned workers and organizers across the United States. Since workers in Buffalo, New York a historic election to form Starbucks' first U.S. union in December 2021, employees at hundreds of locations throughout the nation have started organizing\u2014and have been met with union-busting tactics from the company. Ahead of Schultz's testimony, the HELP Committee a report pointing to dozens of National Labor Relations Board complaints against Starbucks and explaining that \"though the coffee giant claims they are a 'progressive' company, there is mounting evidence that the $113 billion-dollar company's anti-union efforts include a pattern of flagrant violations of federal labor law.\" In their Tuesday , civil rights, environmental, gender justice, and labor groups wrote to Narasimhan, \"It's our hope that you uphold Starbucks' reputation as an inclusive and welcoming for the community by taking this opportunity to redefine the company's relationship with Starbucks partners working in cafes, reserve stores, and roasteries across the country.\" \"While our organizations represent many facets of the progressive movement, we know our fights are inextricably linked to that of Starbucks Workers United.\" \"We stand by workers exercising their fundamental and constitutional right to form a union,\" the progressive coalition emphasized. \"Freedom of association is a constitutional right, and by joining together to bargain collectively with employers, unions give workers the opportunity to have their voices heard and help make decisions to make meaningful changes in their workplaces.\" \"Unions are good for workers, businesses, our economy, and our democracy,\" the coalition continued. \"They are vehicles that advance equity across class, race, sexual orientation, gender, and immigration status. While our organizations represent many facets of the progressive movement, we know our fights are inextricably linked to that of . We cannot have justice\u2014racial, gender, immigrant, climate\u2014without economic justice.\" The letter concludes by highlighting how Narasimhan can chart a new path: \"Instead of continuing on the current path Starbucks has taken, we urge you to create and build a healthy working relationship with unionized partners. We encourage you to affirm workers' legal right to organize a union by signing the and by committing to bargain in good faith with over 7,500 workers who have formed Starbucks Workers United.\" Signatories include the AFL-CIO, American Federation of Teachers, Communications Workers of America, Community Change Action, Center for Popular Democracy, Greenpeace, MoveOn, National Education Association, People's Action, , Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Sierra Club, Sunrise Movement, UltraViolet, United We Dream, and Women's March. \"Starbucks has repeatedly, shamelessly, and illegally stood in the way of partners who are demanding a voice in their workplace and a strong contract to build a better future for themselves and their families,\" said SEIU international president Mary Kay Henry. \"Narasimhan has an opportunity to stop the company's unprecedented, unpopular campaign of union-busting and instead partner with its workers and their union to build a Starbucks that truly lives up to its stated progressive values.\" \u2014 Fight For 15 (@Fight For 15) AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler pointed out that \"Starbucks has always referred to its employees as partners\" and \"under new leadership, the company now has the chance to treat its workers like partners.\" Community Change president Dorian Warren noted that Narasimhan could \"set a powerful example for corporate America by committing to bargain in good faith with the thousands of workers who make his company's success possible.\" \"The importance of organizing can never be overstated,\" Warren added. \"We are proud to support the Starbucks workers who are forming unions, and asking for higher wages, better benefits, and more control over their workplace conditions. We cannot forget that unions are one of the most important tools we have to protect and strengthen our democracy and build equity for all.\" Group leaders also stressed that they represent millions of members and massive movements that support unionization efforts at Starbucks. \"Women's March unites with Starbucks workers\u2014a workforce that is more than 70% women and women of color\u2014as they organize tirelessly to take on the challenges they face in their workplace,\" said executive director Rachel Carmona. \"This is not just a matter of fairness and justice\u2014but a women's rights issue.\" MoveOn executive director Rahna Epting declared that \"Starbucks' record to date on unions has been distasteful, disrespectful, and disingenuous.\" \"Millions of members of MoveOn support workers' rights and want Starbucks to do right by the people who work for your company,\" she told the new CEO. \"Your partners should be able to exercise their rights to freely and fairly organize and negotiate over their working conditions without fear of retaliation.\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ron Wyden urged the administration to ignore the order, calling it a dangerous abuse of power. The Biden White House on Monday said it would not simply ignore a Trump-appointed judge's ruling that could imperil access to a safe abortion medication, dismissing a demand from progressive lawmakers who characterized the decision as a flagrant abuse of judicial power with far-reaching implications. \"No,\" an unnamed White House spokesperson when asked whether it would instruct the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ignore the right-wing judge's ruling invalidating the agency's decades-old approval of mifepristone, which is typically used as to end a pregnancy. \"We stand by FDA's approval of mifepristone, and we are prepared for a long legal fight, if needed,\" the spokesperson continued. \"The focus of the administration is on ensuring that we prevail in the courts. There is a process in place for appealing this decision and we will pursue that process vigorously and do everything we can to prevail in the courts.\" During a briefing on Monday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that \"we are going to always follow the law\" after a reporter asked whether the administration intends to comply with Kacsmaryk's order. \"Doesn't mean that we're not going to fight,\" she added. The White House's adherence to business-as-usual legal procedure comes even as top Biden administration officials acknowledged that, should U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk's ruling be upheld, the entire FDA approval process could be thrown into chaos and placed at the mercy of far-right judges. \"You're not talking about just mifepristone,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra on Sunday. \"You're talking about every kind of drug. You're talking about our vaccines. You're talking about insulin. You're talking about the new Alzheimer's drugs that may come on.\" \"The courts are now going rogue with rulings that no longer even pretend to respect precedent, jurisprudence, or limits to overreach.\" The U.S. Justice Department formally appealed the Texas judge's unilateral ruling on Monday as legal analysts and rights groups grappled with the decision's glaring flaws and potentially profound impacts on abortion rights and other freedoms. \"His order, which applies nationwide, marks the first time in history that a court has claimed the authority to single-handedly pull a drug from the market, a power that courts ,\" court writer Mark Joseph Stern shortly after the ruling was made public Friday evening. \"Kacsmaryk's ruling is indefensible from top to bottom and will go down in history as one of the judiciary's most shocking and lawless moments,\" Stern argued. \"Within an hour of its release, the decision also spurred the start of a constitutional crisis: A federal judge in Washington swiftly issued a dueling injunction compelling the FDA to continue allowing mifepristone in 17 states and the District of Columbia, which brought a separate suit in Washington.\" In a late Friday , Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) characterized Kacsmaryk's ruling as a product of the far right's \"dangerous and undemocratic takeover of our country's institutions\" and said the FDA would be well within its legal authority to ignore it. \"The FDA, doctors, and pharmacies can and must go about their jobs like nothing has changed and keep mifepristone accessible to women across America,\" said Wyden, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee. \"If they don't, the consequences of banning the most common method of abortion in every single state will be devastating.\" Rep. (D-N.Y.) issued a similar call and warned that the failure to resist out-of-control judges \"paves a dangerous road of worsening abuse of power.\" \"The courts are now going rogue with rulings that no longer even pretend to respect precedent, jurisprudence, or limits to overreach,\" the New York Democrat wrote. \"They are long overdue for a check and balance.\" \u2014 (@Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) Even one Republican\u2014Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina\u2014said the FDA should ignore the Texas judge's ruling after one of her GOP colleagues for the agency if it does so. \"This is an FDA-approved drug,\" Mace said in a appearance on Monday. \"Whether you agree with its usage or not, that's not your decision. That is the FDA's decision.\" \u2014 Kaitlan Collins (@Kaitlan Collins) Kacsmaryk's order is set to take effect this coming Friday barring an intervention from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is hearing the Biden administration's legal challenge. The Justice Department, which called the ruling \"extraordinary and unprecedented,\" has requested that the order be put on hold as the legal process plays out. Given the right-wing bent of the fifth circuit, which includes , the chances that Kacsmaryk's order will be upheld appear strong\u2014meaning the case could be on a path to the conservative-dominated U.S. Supreme Court. \"Only the Supreme Court can resolve this looming crisis, and it has a very limited window of time in which to do so,\" Stern last week. \"It has been less than a year since the court claimed to rid itself of the abortion issue. Now it must decide whether American patients will lose access to an abortion drug that has been on the market for 23 years and proven safer than Tylenol\u2014on the order of a single, rogue judge.\" \"After years of David Malpass in the president's office, we cannot afford another second of climate denial leading the bank,\" said one campaigner. Roughly 100 activists marked the opening day of the World Bank Group spring by riding bicycles through the streets of Washington, D.C. on Monday night, calling on incoming bank president Ajay Banga to halt fossil fuel financing and ramp up clean energy and climate justice investments. While demanding a turnaround on green funding in developing countries, the \"Wrong Way on Climate\" bike protest blocked rush-hour traffic outside World Bank headquarters as finance ministers traveled to dinner parties and backroom meetings. \"Bikes are very literally people-powered,\" Hope Neyer, a public health student and organizer with Shutdown D.C., said in a statement. \"They're the ultimate zero-emission vehicles. We chose to gather on bikes tonight to remind the World Bank of the potential we have as individuals and communities to show up for what we believe in\u2014the need to protect our planet, the international right to make healthy choices for our families, and a future that is just and livable for us all.\" The action took place on the first day of the bank's 2023 spring meetings, which are being run this week by outgoing World Bank President David Malpass. Climate advocates in February when Malpass, tapped to lead the bank by then-U.S. President Donald Trump in 2019, said that he plans to step down by the end of June, nearly a year ahead of schedule. The early resignation announcement a sustained against Malpass, who was condemned as a \"climate denier\" after to acknowledge that burning fossil fuels causes the planet-heating pollution underlying increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather disasters around the globe. Activists\u2014whose bike ride started under a banner that reads, \"World Bank: Time for a Fresh Start on Climate\"\u2014are now looking to Malpass' replacement, Banga, to reverse course and scale up decarbonization efforts. Progressives in February U.S. President Joe Biden for nominating the private equity executive and former Mastercard CEO to the role, arguing that he's likely to advance the powerful international financial institution's historically pro-corporate and pro-fossil fuel agenda. Campaigners are wasting no time in pressuring Banga to make the World Bank an instrument for genuinely sustainable development. \"Nominee Banga has the opportunity of a lifetime, if he can rise to the climate challenge.\" \"After years of David Malpass in the president's office, we cannot afford another second of climate denial leading the bank,\" Andrew Nazdin, director of the Glasgow Actions Team, said Monday. \"Nominee Banga has the opportunity of a lifetime, if he can rise to the climate challenge\u2014ending financing oil or gas, ramping up investment in renewables, and becoming the transformative leader the world is begging for.\" In an attempt to defend his record amid criticism last September, Malpass said the World Bank allocated $31.7 billion to climate finance in 2021, with half of it aimed at bolstering adaptation efforts. Not only is that a tiny fraction of the trillions of dollars in green investment the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is needed each year to maintain a habitable planet, but according to by the , Malpass was directly involved in weakening multilateral development banks' (MDBs) joint announcement on climate lending at COP26. After the World Bank itself last year as \"the of climate investments in developing countries,\" Bronwen Tucker of Oil Change International that \"the World Bank Group still funds more fossil fuels than any other MDB, and they continue to lock Global South countries into expensive and volatile fossil fuel contracts through their heavy-handed policy lending programs.\" The Big Shift Global coalition in a recent report that the World Bank has directly financed at least $14.8 billion in fossil fuel production since the signing of the Paris agreement in 2015\u2014negating its 2017 to stop supporting oil and gas projects within two years. The IPCC and the International Energy Agency have that fossil fuel expansion is with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above preindustrial levels, beyond which the climate emergency's consequences will even deadlier, especially for humanity's poorest members who have done the least to cause the crisis. \u2014 The Big Shift Global (@The Big Shift Global) \"As the World Bank and IMF meet behind closed doors to advance the agenda of concentrated corporate and political power, a coalition of D.C.-area activists in solidarity with movements worldwide, especially in the Global South, manifested a very different vision outside,\" Basav Sen, member of the For People For Planet coalition, said Monday. \"We encircled the meetings on bicycle and on foot, to assert the power of organized people.\" Concerned citizens from around the globe are demonstrating throughout the week to demand that the World Bank stop financing fossil fuels. They also plan to call for an overhaul of both Bretton Woods institutions\u2014the World Bank and the \u2014to \"prioritize justice, helping developing countries to green to follow a 1.5\u00b0C roadmap with poverty alleviation at its heart,\" according to the Glasgow Actions Team. \"They will also call to end the 'gentlemen's agreement' that has thus far allowed only the U.S. to nominate the World Bank president.\" On Tuesday morning, activists held a \"First 100 Days\" protest outside World Bank headquarters. They unveiled a first 100 days checklist that outlines what they want incoming bank president Banga to achieve at the start of his five-year term. Campaigners also plan to gather outside the World Bank on Wednesday for a \"Stop Fossil Gas\" demonstration, where they will draw attention to the bank's continued funding of a worldwide expansion of gas pipelines. Activists plan to cap off the week of action with a large march and rally on Friday that features a \"Trojan Horse\" of debt impacts on low-income nations the World Bank works with.",

                  "content": "Todd Groth Todd Groth is Head of Index Research at CoinDesk Indices. . He has over 10 years of experience involving systematic multi-asset risk premia and alternative investment strategies. Follow @ tgroth8 on Twitter It\u2019s been quite a start to the year in the world of crypto. Bitcoin ( BTC ) posted its best quarterly performance in over two years, gaining 68%, for the first three months of 2023. The broader CoinDesk Market Index, or CMI \u2013 which spans over 90% of the crypto market capitalization \u2013 is up 58% on the quarter with ether ( ETH ) and cardano ( ADA ) up 50% and 57% over the same period. Todd Groth is head of research at CoinDesk Indices , a provider of digital asset indices since 2014. The computing sector, or CPU (+67%), benefited from the positive sentiment surrounding artificial intelligence sparked by the the debut of ChatGPT last November. The currency sector, or CCY (+63%), benefited from the U.S. regional bank jitters and from the expansion across central bank balance sheets. January\u2019s rebound in investor sentiment (see \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d) has provided buoyancy for the broad market after a challenging 2022. Digitization, or BTZ (+24%), and DeFi, or DCF (+43%), are also positive for the year. Figure 1: CMI Sector 2023 Performance Attribution; Source: CDI Research Digital assets tend to do best when they trade according to their own narrative (say like bitcoin\u2019s inflation hedge thesis) and decouple from the factors and themes driving traditional asset classes. So far in 2023, crypto appears to be bucking trends driving stocks and bonds, including 2022 inflation fears and quantitative-tightening at the Federal Reserve. Digital assets have less in common now with growth-oriented equities, with a lowering of correlation between digital assets and equities. Within bitcoin specifically, we're also seeing a strengthening in the correlation with gold (positive) and the U.S. dollar (negative). The \u201cdigital gold\u201d and fiat \u201ccurrency debasement hedge\u201d narratives re-emerge and regain investor consideration. Figure 2: One-hour correlations between bitcoin (XBX) vs macro indexes. Source: CDI Research Bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed partly to the steepening of the yield curve in the bond market. We continue to see a moderately negative relationship between bitcoin price changes and the yield curve slope (using the five-year to the 30-year yield spread as proxies), which is a market-derived proxy for interest-rate expectations based on U.S. Treasury bond pricing. The recent peak in U.S. yield curve inversion of +46 basis points on March 8, just before the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, tumbled to -15 basis points as of March 27 as the market priced in fewer rate hikes and cuts post-SVB. This 60 basis-point drop in yield curve slope (with five-year rates dropping more than 30-year rates, bull steeping), combined with the negative correlation of -0.4 between the yield curve slope and bitcoin, suggests one-third of bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed to the steepening of the yield curve. This relationship between bitcoin and the yield curve strengthened during the Silicon Valley Bank event, supporting the digital gold narrative. With the Federal Reserve's balance sheet continuing to expand, in a mere two weeks the new lending facilities created to mitigate the regional banking crisis in March have undone months of balance sheet tightening. The Fed\u2019s actions come alongside continued monetary stimulus coming from the Bank of Japan (buying domestic bonds to maintain yield curve control) and the People\u2019s Bank of China, which is stimulating an economy weakened by COVID lockdowns. From the perspective of a digitally scarce asset like bitcoin, these are all encouraging developments. But it\u2019s unlikely we are heading for a halcyon redux of 2021\u2019s crypto bull market The U.S. regional banking concerns and the rapid unwind of Credit Suisse (CS) have highlighted weaknesses in the traditional financial system when interest rates rise. While this may come to the delight or amusement of crypto maximalists and critics of the fractionalized banking system, it is a source for further deleveraging contagion risk. Most digital-asset investments share a broader portfolio with traditional public and private-asset markets, with capital allocation decisions within these portfolios linking these disparate markets together through relative value choices which promote and drive correlations across markets. Crypto cannot sail alone. That the Fed will make fewer hikes, and more rate cuts, is pretty much priced into the market now and reflected in the yield curve steepening mentioned above. That has benefited bitcoin and gold, and at the expense of the U.S. dollar. A portion of these rate expectations might be due to the move of investors out of banking deposits and into front-end Treasurys for corporate treasury risk-management purposes. Why hold deposits at a regional bank, when you can earn similar interest in short-term paper without the credit risk of a potentially shaky bank? That said, the market appears to view the collapse of SVB as a pivot in the interest-rate hiking cycle. If the tightening of credit conditions and lending standards begin to percolate through the economy and inflation cools down further, then the Federal Reserve will no longer have to hike rates as the credit markets have effectively tightened financial conditions on the Fed\u2019s behalf. But if inflation remains persistent and elevated, the Fed will have to go against market pricing and continue to hike, which has the potential of triggering a redux of 2013's \"Taper Tantrum\" and the liquidation risk mentioned above. Liquidity in crypto markets has dropped with trading volumes post-FTX. Until prices rise enough to reignite interest from traders who exited the market in 2022, we don't expect it to improve. With U.S. regulatory action against exchanges and the closure of a number of banks providing crypto on-ramping services, additional hurdles remain for capital entering into the digital-asset market these days.

                  "content": "James Rubin James Rubin is CoinDesk's U.S. news editor based on the West Coast. Follow @ @JPRubin23 on Twitter Good morning. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening: Prices: Bitcoin and ether are well within the green as they near highs not seen since the Covid-induced bull market. Insights: For former BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes, traditional banking is broken and finance will never be the same. Bitcoin and ether are well within the green as the Asia business day begins, with bitcoin pushing past a yearly high of $30,000, and ether beginning to test $2,000. Crypto-related stocks are also at year-long highs as the price of bitcoin surges. While bitcoin's relationship to the current banking crisis has made it a clear winner over the last month, there are plenty of questions as to how the Ethereum network's Shanghai upgrade is going to impact the price of ether. Is it what ether needs to surge ahead? Or, is ether just following bitcoin's gains? Ether Capital CEO Brian Mosoff calls it a \"non-event.\" \u201cMy suspicion is that this is going to be a non-event in terms of price,\u201d Mosoff told CoinDesk TV\u2019s \u201cFirst Mover\u201d on Monday . \u201cI expect you will see more ETH get locked into staking, either from solo stakers or, again, you\u2019ll see more structured products come to market.\u201d There's also the fact that most of the staked ether is also being held at a loss, as CryptoQuant recently wrote in a report. Meanwhile, the futures market is pricing in modest gains for ether on contracts that expire at the end of June. New inflation data is scheduled to be released on April 12, which should show that the Fed has tamed the beast, and that's always been bullish for crypto and risk assets. Although some have said that there's a new safe haven narrative forming around crypto , the data still shows a tight correlation between it and the S&P 500. \"We are likely to see continued accumulation from longer-term investors interested in its currency debasement hedge properties, while short-term moves are dictated by shifting theories about what monetary liquidity will do,\" Noelle Acheson, the author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, recently wrote. Arthur Hayes Isn't Mincing Words About Banking During the coldest days of 2022\u2019s crypto winter, when the wreckage of FTX was still smoldering, VanEck forecast that bitcoin could drop to $10K-$12K by the first quarter of 2023. \"Bitcoin will test $10,000-$12,000 in Q1 amid a wave of miner bankruptcies, which will mark the low point of the crypto winter,\" Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, wrote at the time. In many ways VanEck was right about the pressure bitcoin has been under: some miners have gone bankrupt , others are engaged in litigation with each other and mining-friendly Texas has passed legislation limiting the benefits available to the industry. But VanEck was wrong about something major: the price of bitcoin. 2023 has been defined by being a mini-bull market. Year-to-date, bitcoin is up about 80%, currently just over $30K. And that\u2019s all in the face of crypto-friendly banks Silvergate and Signature collapse. \"It's all driven by the collapsing of the Western banking system,\" Arthur Hayes said in a recent interview with CoinDesk. \u201cThe world is recognizing the entire Western banking system is bankrupt, and they\u2019re all f\u2014ed.\u201d Bitcoin's correlation with traditional assets is breaking as it serves as an asset outside the traditional fiat banking system, Hayes says, pointing to the S&P 500\u2019s 7% gain year-to-date, versus bitcoin\u2019s more than 80% increase. And what does the Hayes portfolio look like as the Western banking system teeters? Bitcoin, gold, property and maybe even some assets in RMB. \u201cI\u2019m going to go into all these other things that are not connected to the banking system directly,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to own assets in Dubai and all these other regions that actually have a real economy other than just printing money.\u201d Hayes isn\u2019t a total dollar doomer \u2013 his prediction is that it's still going to be in use with the U.S. and her allies, but it will no longer be the world\u2019s reserve currency. The next decade will see the balkanization of currencies, with the dollar making up 40-50% of trade (between 1999-2019 it accounted for 74% of Asia-Pacific trade , and 96% of trade in the Americas). \u201cThe West will be a dollar block, and other non-aligned countries will use gold, Dirhams, CNY, rubles, whatever,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you go to different places you\u2019ll need to use a different currency, and everyone becomes an FX speculator more than they are today.\u201d What about the price of bitcoin? In March, Balaji Srinivasan bet that bitcoin would be $1 million by June 17 on the back of hyperinflation and a failing banking system. On Twitter, he continues to double down on the prediction though prediction markets are giving it a 99% chance of not happening. Hayes doesn\u2019t discount the possibility of bitcoin hitting $1 million, and has been a vocal supporter of Srinivasan on Twitter. But it might not happen for a while. \u201cI know it\u2019s coming, and I think bitcoin just keeps climbing. Will it reach $70,000 this year?

In many states the average balance due runs over $1,000. Having health insurance does help, but deductibles and exclusions can still leave you with a huge bill. A medical emergency that requires an ambulance can easily drive you into debt. People sometimes beg not to be put in ambulances, even in situations where they clearly need them. One Boston resident, her gashed leg caught between a subway train and the platform, pleaded with worried fellow passengers to forego any call to an ambulance service. \"I have terrible health insurance,\" she explained. But things could be worse. Imagine if we had privatized fire departments. We would then see a \"fire-fighting insurance industry\" emerge. Your insurer would receive a bill from the fire-fighting company that put out your fire. These bills would be high, in part because fire companies would have trouble getting poor people to pay them. You would also likely have a giant deductible, and that would leave fires, even for the insured, extremely costly. Many people would become reluctant to call for help. They would try instead to put fires out by themselves, making desperate cost-benefit analyses in a moment of extreme stress instead of just calling the fire department to get their fire extinguished quickly and safely. A privatized fire-fighting system would create ludicrous situations. Saner voices would quickly demand that we return to public fire departments and have everyone, once again, get their fires extinguished for free. Some among us, of course, would likely protest against \"creating\" still another \"costly\" public service.

The resolution will be proposed at the JPMorgan Chase Annual General Meeting on May 16.\"JPMorgan Chase must stop pumping money into an industry that is driving the climate crisis,\" said Kathy Mulvey, director of the Climate Accountability Campaign at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). \"As people around the world face climate-related extreme weather disasters, threats to public health, and systemic economic risk, big banks are choosing to ignore climate science by providing billions of dollars in financing to fossil fuel companies that continue to expand their production of oil and gas. JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions are continuing to mislead shareholders about what is needed to reach global climate goals and instead seeking to maintain a dangerous status quo that prioritizes profit over people and the environment.\"\"To safeguard communities, investors, and the global economy, shareholders should insist that banks incentivize swift and deep cuts in heat-trapping emissions to limit climate change harms and facilitate a just transition to a clean energy economy,\" Mulvey added.The letter was led by prominent scientists Dr. Pep Canadell (Executive Director, Global Carbon Project, CSIRO, Australia), Dr. Rachel Cleetus (Union of Concerned Scientists), Joel Clement (Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School), Dr. Brenda Ekwurzel (Union of Concerned Scientists), Dr. Peter Gleick (Member, US National Academy of Sciences and MacArthur Fellow), Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson (Urban Ocean Lab), Dr. Sarah E.

By ending support for fossil fuel expansion, it could help set the global stage for a just transition to a more sustainable and livable future while acting decisively to protect its shareholders and the wider economy from the financial shocks associated with worsening climate change,\" the scientists write in the letter. \"This is no less than what science requires to keep our planet a livable place for current and future generations, including our children and grandchildren.\"\"To avoid the most dangerous levels of planetary warming, we must rapidly end our reliance on fossil fuels and transition to a clean energy economy that meets the needs of all communities,\" said Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, co-founder of Urban Ocean Lab and a lead signer on the letter. \"Meanwhile, financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase are funding continued expansion of the fossil fuel industry, even as all the warning signs for our planet are flashing red. Big banks must be held accountable for their role in causing the climate crisis\u2014shareholders should insist that banks accelerate and deepen investment in a just, clean energy future.\"Financial institutions are actively funding the climate crisis through their continued financing of fossil fuel expansion. As the scientists point out in their letter, JPMorgan Chase has recklessly provided more than $382 billion in financing for fossil fuel companies since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015, including $65.44 billion to the top 20 companies engaged in the greatest amount of fossil fuel expansion. Meanwhile, the United States experienced 18 separate major climate- and weather-related disasters in 2022, each of which caused over $1 billion in damage. Many of these disasters\u2014including droughts, wildfires and intensified storms\u2014bear the clear fingerprints of climate change. Altogether the 18 events led to the deaths of 474 people and cost an estimated $165 billion, making 2022 the third most costly year for U.S. weather and climate disasters since 1980.\"The science is clear: in order to reduce emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, fossil fuel expansion must stop now, yet JPMorgan Chase and other big banks like Citi, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America continue to pour money into new oil, gas, and coal,\" said Arielle Swernoff, U.S. Banks Campaign Manager at STMP. \"Over 1,300 scientists have come together to say: enough is enough.

Since workers in Buffalo, New York a historic election to form Starbucks' first U.S. union in December 2021, employees at hundreds of locations throughout the nation have started organizing\u2014and have been met with union-busting tactics from the company. Ahead of Schultz's testimony, the HELP Committee a report pointing to dozens of National Labor Relations Board complaints against Starbucks and explaining that \"though the coffee giant claims they are a 'progressive' company, there is mounting evidence that the $113 billion-dollar company's anti-union efforts include a pattern of flagrant violations of federal labor law.\" In their Tuesday , civil rights, environmental, gender justice, and labor groups wrote to Narasimhan, \"It's our hope that you uphold Starbucks' reputation as an inclusive and welcoming for the community by taking this opportunity to redefine the company's relationship with Starbucks partners working in cafes, reserve stores, and roasteries across the country.\" \"While our organizations represent many facets of the progressive movement, we know our fights are inextricably linked to that of Starbucks Workers United.\" \"We stand by workers exercising their fundamental and constitutional right to form a union,\" the progressive coalition emphasized. \"Freedom of association is a constitutional right, and by joining together to bargain collectively with employers, unions give workers the opportunity to have their voices heard and help make decisions to make meaningful changes in their workplaces.\" \"Unions are good for workers, businesses, our economy, and our democracy,\" the coalition continued. \"They are vehicles that advance equity across class, race, sexual orientation, gender, and immigration status.

We encourage you to affirm workers' legal right to organize a union by signing the and by committing to bargain in good faith with over 7,500 workers who have formed Starbucks Workers United.\" Signatories include the AFL-CIO, American Federation of Teachers, Communications Workers of America, Community Change Action, Center for Popular Democracy, Greenpeace, MoveOn, National Education Association, People's Action, , Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Sierra Club, Sunrise Movement, UltraViolet, United We Dream, and Women's March. \"Starbucks has repeatedly, shamelessly, and illegally stood in the way of partners who are demanding a voice in their workplace and a strong contract to build a better future for themselves and their families,\" said SEIU international president Mary Kay Henry. \"Narasimhan has an opportunity to stop the company's unprecedented, unpopular campaign of union-busting and instead partner with its workers and their union to build a Starbucks that truly lives up to its stated progressive values.\" \u2014 Fight For 15 (@Fight For 15) AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler pointed out that \"Starbucks has always referred to its employees as partners\" and \"under new leadership, the company now has the chance to treat its workers like partners.\" Community Change president Dorian Warren noted that Narasimhan could \"set a powerful example for corporate America by committing to bargain in good faith with the thousands of workers who make his company's success possible.\" \"The importance of organizing can never be overstated,\" Warren added. \"We are proud to support the Starbucks workers who are forming unions, and asking for higher wages, better benefits, and more control over their workplace conditions. We cannot forget that unions are one of the most important tools we have to protect and strengthen our democracy and build equity for all.\" Group leaders also stressed that they represent millions of members and massive movements that support unionization efforts at Starbucks. \"Women's March unites with Starbucks workers\u2014a workforce that is more than 70% women and women of color\u2014as they organize tirelessly to take on the challenges they face in their workplace,\" said executive director Rachel Carmona. \"This is not just a matter of fairness and justice\u2014but a women's rights issue.\" MoveOn executive director Rahna Epting declared that \"Starbucks' record to date on unions has been distasteful, disrespectful, and disingenuous.\" \"Millions of members of MoveOn support workers' rights and want Starbucks to do right by the people who work for your company,\" she told the new CEO. \"Your partners should be able to exercise their rights to freely and fairly organize and negotiate over their working conditions without fear of retaliation.\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ron Wyden urged the administration to ignore the order, calling it a dangerous abuse of power. The Biden White House on Monday said it would not simply ignore a Trump-appointed judge's ruling that could imperil access to a safe abortion medication, dismissing a demand from progressive lawmakers who characterized the decision as a flagrant abuse of judicial power with far-reaching implications. \"No,\" an unnamed White House spokesperson when asked whether it would instruct the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ignore the right-wing judge's ruling invalidating the agency's decades-old approval of mifepristone, which is typically used as to end a pregnancy. \"We stand by FDA's approval of mifepristone, and we are prepared for a long legal fight, if needed,\" the spokesperson continued. \"The focus of the administration is on ensuring that we prevail in the courts. There is a process in place for appealing this decision and we will pursue that process vigorously and do everything we can to prevail in the courts.\" During a briefing on Monday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that \"we are going to always follow the law\" after a reporter asked whether the administration intends to comply with Kacsmaryk's order. \"Doesn't mean that we're not going to fight,\" she added. The White House's adherence to business-as-usual legal procedure comes even as top Biden administration officials acknowledged that, should U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk's ruling be upheld, the entire FDA approval process could be thrown into chaos and placed at the mercy of far-right judges. \"You're not talking about just mifepristone,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra on Sunday. \"You're talking about every kind of drug. You're talking about our vaccines. You're talking about insulin. You're talking about the new Alzheimer's drugs that may come on.\" \"The courts are now going rogue with rulings that no longer even pretend to respect precedent, jurisprudence, or limits to overreach.\" The U.S. Justice Department formally appealed the Texas judge's unilateral ruling on Monday as legal analysts and rights groups grappled with the decision's glaring flaws and potentially profound impacts on abortion rights and other freedoms. \"His order, which applies nationwide, marks the first time in history that a court has claimed the authority to single-handedly pull a drug from the market, a power that courts ,\" court writer Mark Joseph Stern shortly after the ruling was made public Friday evening. \"Kacsmaryk's ruling is indefensible from top to bottom and will go down in history as one of the judiciary's most shocking and lawless moments,\" Stern argued. \"Within an hour of its release, the decision also spurred the start of a constitutional crisis: A federal judge in Washington swiftly issued a dueling injunction compelling the FDA to continue allowing mifepristone in 17 states and the District of Columbia, which brought a separate suit in Washington.\" In a late Friday , Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) characterized Kacsmaryk's ruling as a product of the far right's \"dangerous and undemocratic takeover of our country's institutions\" and said the FDA would be well within its legal authority to ignore it. \"The FDA, doctors, and pharmacies can and must go about their jobs like nothing has changed and keep mifepristone accessible to women across America,\" said Wyden, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee. \"If they don't, the consequences of banning the most common method of abortion in every single state will be devastating.\" Rep. (D-N.Y.) issued a similar call and warned that the failure to resist out-of-control judges \"paves a dangerous road of worsening abuse of power.\" \"The courts are now going rogue with rulings that no longer even pretend to respect precedent, jurisprudence, or limits to overreach,\" the New York Democrat wrote. \"They are long overdue for a check and balance.\" \u2014 (@Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) Even one Republican\u2014Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina\u2014said the FDA should ignore the Texas judge's ruling after one of her GOP colleagues for the agency if it does so. \"This is an FDA-approved drug,\" Mace said in a appearance on Monday. \"Whether you agree with its usage or not, that's not your decision. That is the FDA's decision.\" \u2014 Kaitlan Collins (@Kaitlan Collins) Kacsmaryk's order is set to take effect this coming Friday barring an intervention from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is hearing the Biden administration's legal challenge. The Justice Department, which called the ruling \"extraordinary and unprecedented,\" has requested that the order be put on hold as the legal process plays out. Given the right-wing bent of the fifth circuit, which includes , the chances that Kacsmaryk's order will be upheld appear strong\u2014meaning the case could be on a path to the conservative-dominated U.S. Supreme Court. \"Only the Supreme Court can resolve this looming crisis, and it has a very limited window of time in which to do so,\" Stern last week. \"It has been less than a year since the court claimed to rid itself of the abortion issue. Now it must decide whether American patients will lose access to an abortion drug that has been on the market for 23 years and proven safer than Tylenol\u2014on the order of a single, rogue judge.\" \"After years of David Malpass in the president's office, we cannot afford another second of climate denial leading the bank,\" said one campaigner. Roughly 100 activists marked the opening day of the World Bank Group spring by riding bicycles through the streets of Washington, D.C. on Monday night, calling on incoming bank president Ajay Banga to halt fossil fuel financing and ramp up clean energy and climate justice investments. While demanding a turnaround on green funding in developing countries, the \"Wrong Way on Climate\" bike protest blocked rush-hour traffic outside World Bank headquarters as finance ministers traveled to dinner parties and backroom meetings. \"Bikes are very literally people-powered,\" Hope Neyer, a public health student and organizer with Shutdown D.C., said in a statement. \"They're the ultimate zero-emission vehicles. We chose to gather on bikes tonight to remind the World Bank of the potential we have as individuals and communities to show up for what we believe in\u2014the need to protect our planet, the international right to make healthy choices for our families, and a future that is just and livable for us all.\" The action took place on the first day of the bank's 2023 spring meetings, which are being run this week by outgoing World Bank President David Malpass. Climate advocates in February when Malpass, tapped to lead the bank by then-U.S. President Donald Trump in 2019, said that he plans to step down by the end of June, nearly a year ahead of schedule. The early resignation announcement a sustained against Malpass, who was condemned as a \"climate denier\" after to acknowledge that burning fossil fuels causes the planet-heating pollution underlying increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather disasters around the globe. Activists\u2014whose bike ride started under a banner that reads, \"World Bank: Time for a Fresh Start on Climate\"\u2014are now looking to Malpass' replacement, Banga, to reverse course and scale up decarbonization efforts. Progressives in February U.S. President Joe Biden for nominating the private equity executive and former Mastercard CEO to the role, arguing that he's likely to advance the powerful international financial institution's historically pro-corporate and pro-fossil fuel agenda. Campaigners are wasting no time in pressuring Banga to make the World Bank an instrument for genuinely sustainable development. \"Nominee Banga has the opportunity of a lifetime, if he can rise to the climate challenge.\" \"After years of David Malpass in the president's office, we cannot afford another second of climate denial leading the bank,\" Andrew Nazdin, director of the Glasgow Actions Team, said Monday. \"Nominee Banga has the opportunity of a lifetime, if he can rise to the climate challenge\u2014ending financing oil or gas, ramping up investment in renewables, and becoming the transformative leader the world is begging for.\" In an attempt to defend his record amid criticism last September, Malpass said the World Bank allocated $31.7 billion to climate finance in 2021, with half of it aimed at bolstering adaptation efforts. Not only is that a tiny fraction of the trillions of dollars in green investment the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is needed each year to maintain a habitable planet, but according to by the , Malpass was directly involved in weakening multilateral development banks' (MDBs) joint announcement on climate lending at COP26. After the World Bank itself last year as \"the of climate investments in developing countries,\" Bronwen Tucker of Oil Change International that \"the World Bank Group still funds more fossil fuels than any other MDB, and they continue to lock Global South countries into expensive and volatile fossil fuel contracts through their heavy-handed policy lending programs.\" The Big Shift Global coalition in a recent report that the World Bank has directly financed at least $14.8 billion in fossil fuel production since the signing of the Paris agreement in 2015\u2014negating its 2017 to stop supporting oil and gas projects within two years. The IPCC and the International Energy Agency have that fossil fuel expansion is with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above preindustrial levels, beyond which the climate emergency's consequences will even deadlier, especially for humanity's poorest members who have done the least to cause the crisis. \u2014 The Big Shift Global (@The Big Shift Global) \"As the World Bank and IMF meet behind closed doors to advance the agenda of concentrated corporate and political power, a coalition of D.C.-area activists in solidarity with movements worldwide, especially in the Global South, manifested a very different vision outside,\" Basav Sen, member of the For People For Planet coalition, said Monday. \"We encircled the meetings on bicycle and on foot, to assert the power of organized people.\" Concerned citizens from around the globe are demonstrating throughout the week to demand that the World Bank stop financing fossil fuels. They also plan to call for an overhaul of both Bretton Woods institutions\u2014the World Bank and the \u2014to \"prioritize justice, helping developing countries to green to follow a 1.5\u00b0C roadmap with poverty alleviation at its heart,\" according to the Glasgow Actions Team. \"They will also call to end the 'gentlemen's agreement' that has thus far allowed only the U.S. to nominate the World Bank president.\" On Tuesday morning, activists held a \"First 100 Days\" protest outside World Bank headquarters. They unveiled a first 100 days checklist that outlines what they want incoming bank president Banga to achieve at the start of his five-year term. Campaigners also plan to gather outside the World Bank on Wednesday for a \"Stop Fossil Gas\" demonstration, where they will draw attention to the bank's continued funding of a worldwide expansion of gas pipelines. Activists plan to cap off the week of action with a large march and rally on Friday that features a \"Trojan Horse\" of debt impacts on low-income nations the World Bank works with.",

                  "content": "Todd Groth Todd Groth is Head of Index Research at CoinDesk Indices. . He has over 10 years of experience involving systematic multi-asset risk premia and alternative investment strategies. Follow @ tgroth8 on Twitter It\u2019s been quite a start to the year in the world of crypto. Bitcoin ( BTC ) posted its best quarterly performance in over two years, gaining 68%, for the first three months of 2023. The broader CoinDesk Market Index, or CMI \u2013 which spans over 90% of the crypto market capitalization \u2013 is up 58% on the quarter with ether ( ETH ) and cardano ( ADA ) up 50% and 57% over the same period. Todd Groth is head of research at CoinDesk Indices , a provider of digital asset indices since 2014. The computing sector, or CPU (+67%), benefited from the positive sentiment surrounding artificial intelligence sparked by the the debut of ChatGPT last November. The currency sector, or CCY (+63%), benefited from the U.S. regional bank jitters and from the expansion across central bank balance sheets. January\u2019s rebound in investor sentiment (see \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d) has provided buoyancy for the broad market after a challenging 2022. Digitization, or BTZ (+24%), and DeFi, or DCF (+43%), are also positive for the year. Figure 1: CMI Sector 2023 Performance Attribution; Source: CDI Research Digital assets tend to do best when they trade according to their own narrative (say like bitcoin\u2019s inflation hedge thesis) and decouple from the factors and themes driving traditional asset classes. So far in 2023, crypto appears to be bucking trends driving stocks and bonds, including 2022 inflation fears and quantitative-tightening at the Federal Reserve. Digital assets have less in common now with growth-oriented equities, with a lowering of correlation between digital assets and equities. Within bitcoin specifically, we're also seeing a strengthening in the correlation with gold (positive) and the U.S. dollar (negative). The \u201cdigital gold\u201d and fiat \u201ccurrency debasement hedge\u201d narratives re-emerge and regain investor consideration. Figure 2: One-hour correlations between bitcoin (XBX) vs macro indexes. Source: CDI Research Bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed partly to the steepening of the yield curve in the bond market. We continue to see a moderately negative relationship between bitcoin price changes and the yield curve slope (using the five-year to the 30-year yield spread as proxies), which is a market-derived proxy for interest-rate expectations based on U.S. Treasury bond pricing. The recent peak in U.S. yield curve inversion of +46 basis points on March 8, just before the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, tumbled to -15 basis points as of March 27 as the market priced in fewer rate hikes and cuts post-SVB. This 60 basis-point drop in yield curve slope (with five-year rates dropping more than 30-year rates, bull steeping), combined with the negative correlation of -0.4 between the yield curve slope and bitcoin, suggests one-third of bitcoin\u2019s 25% gain during the regional banking crisis can be attributed to the steepening of the yield curve. This relationship between bitcoin and the yield curve strengthened during the Silicon Valley Bank event, supporting the digital gold narrative. With the Federal Reserve's balance sheet continuing to expand, in a mere two weeks the new lending facilities created to mitigate the regional banking crisis in March have undone months of balance sheet tightening. The Fed\u2019s actions come alongside continued monetary stimulus coming from the Bank of Japan (buying domestic bonds to maintain yield curve control) and the People\u2019s Bank of China, which is stimulating an economy weakened by COVID lockdowns. From the perspective of a digitally scarce asset like bitcoin, these are all encouraging developments. But it\u2019s unlikely we are heading for a halcyon redux of 2021\u2019s crypto bull market The U.S. regional banking concerns and the rapid unwind of Credit Suisse (CS) have highlighted weaknesses in the traditional financial system when interest rates rise. While this may come to the delight or amusement of crypto maximalists and critics of the fractionalized banking system, it is a source for further deleveraging contagion risk. Most digital-asset investments share a broader portfolio with traditional public and private-asset markets, with capital allocation decisions within these portfolios linking these disparate markets together through relative value choices which promote and drive correlations across markets. Crypto cannot sail alone. That the Fed will make fewer hikes, and more rate cuts, is pretty much priced into the market now and reflected in the yield curve steepening mentioned above. That has benefited bitcoin and gold, and at the expense of the U.S. dollar. A portion of these rate expectations might be due to the move of investors out of banking deposits and into front-end Treasurys for corporate treasury risk-management purposes. Why hold deposits at a regional bank, when you can earn similar interest in short-term paper without the credit risk of a potentially shaky bank? That said, the market appears to view the collapse of SVB as a pivot in the interest-rate hiking cycle. If the tightening of credit conditions and lending standards begin to percolate through the economy and inflation cools down further, then the Federal Reserve will no longer have to hike rates as the credit markets have effectively tightened financial conditions on the Fed\u2019s behalf. But if inflation remains persistent and elevated, the Fed will have to go against market pricing and continue to hike, which has the potential of triggering a redux of 2013's \"Taper Tantrum\" and the liquidation risk mentioned above. Liquidity in crypto markets has dropped with trading volumes post-FTX. Until prices rise enough to reignite interest from traders who exited the market in 2022, we don't expect it to improve. With U.S. regulatory action against exchanges and the closure of a number of banks providing crypto on-ramping services, additional hurdles remain for capital entering into the digital-asset market these days.

                  "description": "ALSO: Sam Reynolds writes that former BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes foresees the balkanization of finance and bitcoin rallying because the current global banking system \"is bankrupt.\" Bitcoin is on the rise.",
                  "content": "James Rubin James Rubin is CoinDesk's U.S. news editor based on the West Coast. Follow @ @JPRubin23 on Twitter Good morning. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening: Prices: Bitcoin and ether are well within the green as they near highs not seen since the Covid-induced bull market. Insights: For former BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes, traditional banking is broken and finance will never be the same. Bitcoin and ether are well within the green as the Asia business day begins, with bitcoin pushing past a yearly high of $30,000, and ether beginning to test $2,000. Crypto-related stocks are also at year-long highs as the price of bitcoin surges. While bitcoin's relationship to the current banking crisis has made it a clear winner over the last month, there are plenty of questions as to how the Ethereum network's Shanghai upgrade is going to impact the price of ether. Is it what ether needs to surge ahead? Or, is ether just following bitcoin's gains? Ether Capital CEO Brian Mosoff calls it a \"non-event.\" \u201cMy suspicion is that this is going to be a non-event in terms of price,\u201d Mosoff told CoinDesk TV\u2019s \u201cFirst Mover\u201d on Monday . \u201cI expect you will see more ETH get locked into staking, either from solo stakers or, again, you\u2019ll see more structured products come to market.\u201d There's also the fact that most of the staked ether is also being held at a loss, as CryptoQuant recently wrote in a report. Meanwhile, the futures market is pricing in modest gains for ether on contracts that expire at the end of June. New inflation data is scheduled to be released on April 12, which should show that the Fed has tamed the beast, and that's always been bullish for crypto and risk assets. Although some have said that there's a new safe haven narrative forming around crypto , the data still shows a tight correlation between it and the S&P 500. \"We are likely to see continued accumulation from longer-term investors interested in its currency debasement hedge properties, while short-term moves are dictated by shifting theories about what monetary liquidity will do,\" Noelle Acheson, the author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, recently wrote. Arthur Hayes Isn't Mincing Words About Banking During the coldest days of 2022\u2019s crypto winter, when the wreckage of FTX was still smoldering, VanEck forecast that bitcoin could drop to $10K-$12K by the first quarter of 2023. \"Bitcoin will test $10,000-$12,000 in Q1 amid a wave of miner bankruptcies, which will mark the low point of the crypto winter,\" Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, wrote at the time. In many ways VanEck was right about the pressure bitcoin has been under: some miners have gone bankrupt , others are engaged in litigation with each other and mining-friendly Texas has passed legislation limiting the benefits available to the industry. But VanEck was wrong about something major: the price of bitcoin. 2023 has been defined by being a mini-bull market. Year-to-date, bitcoin is up about 80%, currently just over $30K. And that\u2019s all in the face of crypto-friendly banks Silvergate and Signature collapse. \"It's all driven by the collapsing of the Western banking system,\" Arthur Hayes said in a recent interview with CoinDesk. \u201cThe world is recognizing the entire Western banking system is bankrupt, and they\u2019re all f\u2014ed.\u201d Bitcoin's correlation with traditional assets is breaking as it serves as an asset outside the traditional fiat banking system, Hayes says, pointing to the S&P 500\u2019s 7% gain year-to-date, versus bitcoin\u2019s more than 80% increase. And what does the Hayes portfolio look like as the Western banking system teeters? Bitcoin, gold, property and maybe even some assets in RMB. \u201cI\u2019m going to go into all these other things that are not connected to the banking system directly,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to own assets in Dubai and all these other regions that actually have a real economy other than just printing money.\u201d Hayes isn\u2019t a total dollar doomer \u2013 his prediction is that it's still going to be in use with the U.S. and her allies, but it will no longer be the world\u2019s reserve currency. The next decade will see the balkanization of currencies, with the dollar making up 40-50% of trade (between 1999-2019 it accounted for 74% of Asia-Pacific trade , and 96% of trade in the Americas). \u201cThe West will be a dollar block, and other non-aligned countries will use gold, Dirhams, CNY, rubles, whatever,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you go to different places you\u2019ll need to use a different currency, and everyone becomes an FX speculator more than they are today.\u201d What about the price of bitcoin? In March, Balaji Srinivasan bet that bitcoin would be $1 million by June 17 on the back of hyperinflation and a failing banking system. On Twitter, he continues to double down on the prediction though prediction markets are giving it a 99% chance of not happening. Hayes doesn\u2019t discount the possibility of bitcoin hitting $1 million, and has been a vocal supporter of Srinivasan on Twitter. But it might not happen for a while. \u201cI know it\u2019s coming, and I think bitcoin just keeps climbing. Will it reach $70,000 this year? I doubt it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2024 there will be the halving, and more banks that have gone bankrupt in the U.S. and Europe. You\u2019ll probably also have a very explicit guarantee of all deposits in the Western world by central banks.\u201d At this point, Hayes argues, the market will know it needs to be in bitcoin, gold, ether, or other assets. \u201cAnything that isn\u2019t stocks and government bonds,\u201d he says.

In virtually all cities, fire departments operate as a public service financed by local government, usually via property taxes. But if you call 911 for an ambulance, you could face a huge bill, even for a short ride. Ambulances typically don't operate as a free public service. In many states the average balance due runs over $1,000. Having health insurance does help, but deductibles and exclusions can still leave you with a huge bill. A medical emergency that requires an ambulance can easily drive you into debt. People sometimes beg not to be put in ambulances, even in situations where they clearly need them. One Boston resident, her gashed leg caught between a subway train and the platform, pleaded with worried fellow passengers to forego any call to an ambulance service. \"I have terrible health insurance,\" she explained. But things could be worse. Imagine if we had privatized fire departments. We would then see a \"fire-fighting insurance industry\" emerge. Your insurer would receive a bill from the fire-fighting company that put out your fire. These bills would be high, in part because fire companies would have trouble getting poor people to pay them. You would also likely have a giant deductible, and that would leave fires, even for the insured, extremely costly. Many people would become reluctant to call for help. They would try instead to put fires out by themselves, making desperate cost-benefit analyses in a moment of extreme stress instead of just calling the fire department to get their fire extinguished quickly and safely. A privatized fire-fighting system would create ludicrous situations. Saner voices would quickly demand that we return to public fire departments and have everyone, once again, get their fires extinguished for free. Some among us, of course, would likely protest against \"creating\" still another \"costly\" public service. They would lodge against public fire departments the standard conservative arguments against left-leaning health care plans. So you actually trust, these critics would argue, the government to put out your fires? People deserve a choice about how to finance extinguishing the flames that are burning down their houses. And many people like their private fire insurance. You want to take it away from them! You want to eliminate jobs in the private firefighting insurance industry? You want to raise taxes and hurt the economy? Tax-funded fire departments, the argument would continue, put us on a slippery slope to collectivism. My own belief? Ambulances should be close to free, with perhaps a $50 fee to prevent over-use. Based on three million ambulance rides a year, nationwide, the cost of providing this ambulance access would only take about $4 billion a year in new spending, frankly just a rounding error in federal health budgets.",

Based on three million ambulance rides a year, nationwide, the cost of providing this ambulance access would only take about $4 billion a year in new spending, frankly just a rounding error in federal health budgets. If you call 911 and the fire department comes, you will generally pay nothing. In virtually all cities, fire departments operate as a public service financed by local government, usually via property taxes. But if you call 911 for an ambulance, you could face a huge bill, even for a short ride. Ambulances typically don't operate as a free public service. In many states the average balance due over $1,000. Having health insurance does help, but deductibles and exclusions can still leave you with a huge bill. A medical emergency that requires an ambulance can easily drive you into debt. People sometimes not to be put in ambulances, even in situations where they clearly need them. One Boston resident, her gashed leg caught between a subway train and the platform, with worried fellow passengers to forego any call to an ambulance service. \"I have terrible health insurance,\" she explained. But things could be worse. Imagine if we had privatized fire departments. We would then see a \"fire-fighting insurance industry\" emerge. Your insurer would receive a bill from the fire-fighting company that put out your fire. These bills would be high, in part because fire companies would have trouble getting poor people to pay them. You would also likely have a giant deductible, and that would leave fires, even for the insured, extremely costly. Many people would become reluctant to call for help. They would try instead to put fires out by themselves, making desperate cost-benefit analyses in a moment of extreme stress instead of just calling the fire department to get their fire extinguished quickly and safely. A privatized fire-fighting system would create ludicrous situations. Saner voices would quickly demand that we return to public fire departments and have everyone, once again, get their fires extinguished for free. Some among us, of course, would likely protest against \"creating\" still another \"costly\" public service. They would lodge against public fire departments the standard conservative arguments against left-leaning health care plans. So you actually trust, these critics would argue, to put out your fires? People deserve about how to finance extinguishing the flames that are burning down their houses. And many people like their private fire insurance. You want to from them!

The resolution will be proposed at the JPMorgan Chase Annual General Meeting on May 16.\"JPMorgan Chase must stop pumping money into an industry that is driving the climate crisis,\" said Kathy Mulvey, director of the Climate Accountability Campaign at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). \"As people around the world face climate-related extreme weather disasters, threats to public health, and systemic economic risk, big banks are choosing to ignore climate science by providing billions of dollars in financing to fossil fuel companies that continue to expand their production of oil and gas. JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions are continuing to mislead shareholders about what is needed to reach global climate goals and instead seeking to maintain a dangerous status quo that prioritizes profit over people and the environment.\"\"To safeguard communities, investors, and the global economy, shareholders should insist that banks incentivize swift and deep cuts in heat-trapping emissions to limit climate change harms and facilitate a just transition to a clean energy economy,\" Mulvey added.The letter was led by prominent scientists Dr. Pep Canadell (Executive Director, Global Carbon Project, CSIRO, Australia), Dr. Rachel Cleetus (Union of Concerned Scientists), Joel Clement (Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School), Dr. Brenda Ekwurzel (Union of Concerned Scientists), Dr. Peter Gleick (Member, US National Academy of Sciences and MacArthur Fellow), Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson (Urban Ocean Lab), Dr. Sarah E.

As the scientists point out in their letter, JPMorgan Chase has recklessly provided more than $382 billion in financing for fossil fuel companies since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015, including $65.44 billion to the top 20 companies engaged in the greatest amount of fossil fuel expansion. Meanwhile, the United States experienced 18 separate major climate- and weather-related disasters in 2022, each of which caused over $1 billion in damage. Many of these disasters\u2014including droughts, wildfires and intensified storms\u2014bear the clear fingerprints of climate change.

UCS and the Adrian Dominican Sisters filed the letter as an with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \"Instead of continuing on the current path Starbucks has taken, we urge you to create and build a healthy working relationship with unionized partners.\" A progressive coalition representing 62 million people and nearly 500 member organizations on Tuesday urged new Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan to end the coffee giant's hostility toward unioned workers and organizers across the United States. Since workers in Buffalo, New York a historic election to form Starbucks' first U.S. union in December 2021, employees at hundreds of locations throughout the nation have started organizing\u2014and have been met with union-busting tactics from the company. Ahead of Schultz's testimony, the HELP Committee a report pointing to dozens of National Labor Relations Board complaints against Starbucks and explaining that \"though the coffee giant claims they are a 'progressive' company, there is mounting evidence that the $113 billion-dollar company's anti-union efforts include a pattern of flagrant violations of federal labor law.\" In their Tuesday , civil rights, environmental, gender justice, and labor groups wrote to Narasimhan, \"It's our hope that you uphold Starbucks' reputation as an inclusive and welcoming for the community by taking this opportunity to redefine the company's relationship with Starbucks partners working in cafes, reserve stores, and roasteries across the country.\" \"While our organizations represent many facets of the progressive movement, we know our fights are inextricably linked to that of Starbucks Workers United.\" \"We stand by workers exercising their fundamental and constitutional right to form a union,\" the progressive coalition emphasized. \"Freedom of association is a constitutional right, and by joining together to bargain collectively with employers, unions give workers the opportunity to have their voices heard and help make decisions to make meaningful changes in their workplaces.\" \"Unions are good for workers, businesses, our economy, and our democracy,\" the coalition continued. \"They are vehicles that advance equity across class, race, sexual orientation, gender, and immigration status. While our organizations represent many facets of the progressive movement, we know our fights are inextricably linked to that of . We cannot have justice\u2014racial, gender, immigrant, climate\u2014without economic justice.\" The letter concludes by highlighting how Narasimhan can chart a new path: \"Instead of continuing on the current path Starbucks has taken, we urge you to create and build a healthy working relationship with unionized partners. We encourage you to affirm workers' legal right to organize a union by signing the and by committing to bargain in good faith with over 7,500 workers who have formed Starbucks Workers United.\" Signatories include the AFL-CIO, American Federation of Teachers, Communications Workers of America, Community Change Action, Center for Popular Democracy, Greenpeace, MoveOn, National Education Association, People's Action, , Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Sierra Club, Sunrise Movement, UltraViolet, United We Dream, and Women's March. \"Starbucks has repeatedly, shamelessly, and illegally stood in the way of partners who are demanding a voice in their workplace and a strong contract to build a better future for themselves and their families,\" said SEIU international president Mary Kay Henry. \"Narasimhan has an opportunity to stop the company's unprecedented, unpopular campaign of union-busting and instead partner with its workers and their union to build a Starbucks that truly lives up to its stated progressive values.\" \u2014 Fight For 15 (@Fight For 15) AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler pointed out that \"Starbucks has always referred to its employees as partners\" and \"under new leadership, the company now has the chance to treat its workers like partners.\" Community Change president Dorian Warren noted that Narasimhan could \"set a powerful example for corporate America by committing to bargain in good faith with the thousands of workers who make his company's success possible.\" \"The importance of organizing can never be overstated,\" Warren added. \"We are proud to support the Starbucks workers who are forming unions, and asking for higher wages, better benefits, and more control over their workplace conditions. We cannot forget that unions are one of the most important tools we have to protect and strengthen our democracy and build equity for all.\" Group leaders also stressed that they represent millions of members and massive movements that support unionization efforts at Starbucks. \"Women's March unites with Starbucks workers\u2014a workforce that is more than 70% women and women of color\u2014as they organize tirelessly to take on the challenges they face in their workplace,\" said executive director Rachel Carmona. \"This is not just a matter of fairness and justice\u2014but a women's rights issue.\" MoveOn executive director Rahna Epting declared that \"Starbucks' record to date on unions has been distasteful, disrespectful, and disingenuous.\" \"Millions of members of MoveOn support workers' rights and want Starbucks to do right by the people who work for your company,\" she told the new CEO. \"Your partners should be able to exercise their rights to freely and fairly organize and negotiate over their working conditions without fear of retaliation.\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ron Wyden urged the administration to ignore the order, calling it a dangerous abuse of power. The Biden White House on Monday said it would not simply ignore a Trump-appointed judge's ruling that could imperil access to a safe abortion medication, dismissing a demand from progressive lawmakers who characterized the decision as a flagrant abuse of judicial power with far-reaching implications. \"No,\" an unnamed White House spokesperson when asked whether it would instruct the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ignore the right-wing judge's ruling invalidating the agency's decades-old approval of mifepristone, which is typically used as to end a pregnancy. \"We stand by FDA's approval of mifepristone, and we are prepared for a long legal fight, if needed,\" the spokesperson continued. \"The focus of the administration is on ensuring that we prevail in the courts. There is a process in place for appealing this decision and we will pursue that process vigorously and do everything we can to prevail in the courts.\" During a briefing on Monday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that \"we are going to always follow the law\" after a reporter asked whether the administration intends to comply with Kacsmaryk's order. \"Doesn't mean that we're not going to fight,\" she added. The White House's adherence to business-as-usual legal procedure comes even as top Biden administration officials acknowledged that, should U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk's ruling be upheld, the entire FDA approval process could be thrown into chaos and placed at the mercy of far-right judges. \"You're not talking about just mifepristone,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra on Sunday. \"You're talking about every kind of drug. You're talking about our vaccines. You're talking about insulin. You're talking about the new Alzheimer's drugs that may come on.\" \"The courts are now going rogue with rulings that no longer even pretend to respect precedent, jurisprudence, or limits to overreach.\" The U.S. Justice Department formally appealed the Texas judge's unilateral ruling on Monday as legal analysts and rights groups grappled with the decision's glaring flaws and potentially profound impacts on abortion rights and other freedoms. \"His order, which applies nationwide, marks the first time in history that a court has claimed the authority to single-handedly pull a drug from the market, a power that courts ,\" court writer Mark Joseph Stern shortly after the ruling was made public Friday evening. \"Kacsmaryk's ruling is indefensible from top to bottom and will go down in history as one of the judiciary's most shocking and lawless moments,\" Stern argued. \"Within an hour of its release, the decision also spurred the start of a constitutional crisis: A federal judge in Washington swiftly issued a dueling injunction compelling the FDA to continue allowing mifepristone in 17 states and the District of Columbia, which brought a separate suit in Washington.\" In a late Friday , Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) characterized Kacsmaryk's ruling as a product of the far right's \"dangerous and undemocratic takeover of our country's institutions\" and said the FDA would be well within its legal authority to ignore it. \"The FDA, doctors, and pharmacies can and must go about their jobs like nothing has changed and keep mifepristone accessible to women across America,\" said Wyden, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee. \"If they don't, the consequences of banning the most common method of abortion in every single state will be devastating.\" Rep. (D-N.Y.) issued a similar call and warned that the failure to resist out-of-control judges \"paves a dangerous road of worsening abuse of power.\" \"The courts are now going rogue with rulings that no longer even pretend to respect precedent, jurisprudence, or limits to overreach,\" the New York Democrat wrote. \"They are long overdue for a check and balance.\" \u2014 (@Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) Even one Republican\u2014Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina\u2014said the FDA should ignore the Texas judge's ruling after one of her GOP colleagues for the agency if it does so. \"This is an FDA-approved drug,\" Mace said in a appearance on Monday. \"Whether you agree with its usage or not, that's not your decision. That is the FDA's decision.\" \u2014 Kaitlan Collins (@Kaitlan Collins) Kacsmaryk's order is set to take effect this coming Friday barring an intervention from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is hearing the Biden administration's legal challenge. The Justice Department, which called the ruling \"extraordinary and unprecedented,\" has requested that the order be put on hold as the legal process plays out. Given the right-wing bent of the fifth circuit, which includes , the chances that Kacsmaryk's order will be upheld appear strong\u2014meaning the case could be on a path to the conservative-dominated U.S. Supreme Court. \"Only the Supreme Court can resolve this looming crisis, and it has a very limited window of time in which to do so,\" Stern last week. \"It has been less than a year since the court claimed to rid itself of the abortion issue. Now it must decide whether American patients will lose access to an abortion drug that has been on the market for 23 years and proven safer than Tylenol\u2014on the order of a single, rogue judge.\" \"After years of David Malpass in the president's office, we cannot afford another second of climate denial leading the bank,\" said one campaigner. Roughly 100 activists marked the opening day of the World Bank Group spring by riding bicycles through the streets of Washington, D.C. on Monday night, calling on incoming bank president Ajay Banga to halt fossil fuel financing and ramp up clean energy and climate justice investments. While demanding a turnaround on green funding in developing countries, the \"Wrong Way on Climate\" bike protest blocked rush-hour traffic outside World Bank headquarters as finance ministers traveled to dinner parties and backroom meetings. \"Bikes are very literally people-powered,\" Hope Neyer, a public health student and organizer with Shutdown D.C., said in a statement. \"They're the ultimate zero-emission vehicles. We chose to gather on bikes tonight to remind the World Bank of the potential we have as individuals and communities to show up for what we believe in\u2014the need to protect our planet, the international right to make healthy choices for our families, and a future that is just and livable for us all.\" The action took place on the first day of the bank's 2023 spring meetings, which are being run this week by outgoing World Bank President David Malpass. Climate advocates in February when Malpass, tapped to lead the bank by then-U.S. President Donald Trump in 2019, said that he plans to step down by the end of June, nearly a year ahead of schedule. The early resignation announcement a sustained against Malpass, who was condemned as a \"climate denier\" after to acknowledge that burning fossil fuels causes the planet-heating pollution underlying increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather disasters around the globe. Activists\u2014whose bike ride started under a banner that reads, \"World Bank: Time for a Fresh Start on Climate\"\u2014are now looking to Malpass' replacement, Banga, to reverse course and scale up decarbonization efforts. Progressives in February U.S. President Joe Biden for nominating the private equity executive and former Mastercard CEO to the role, arguing that he's likely to advance the powerful international financial institution's historically pro-corporate and pro-fossil fuel agenda. Campaigners are wasting no time in pressuring Banga to make the World Bank an instrument for genuinely sustainable development. \"Nominee Banga has the opportunity of a lifetime, if he can rise to the climate challenge.\" \"After years of David Malpass in the president's office, we cannot afford another second of climate denial leading the bank,\" Andrew Nazdin, director of the Glasgow Actions Team, said Monday. \"Nominee Banga has the opportunity of a lifetime, if he can rise to the climate challenge\u2014ending financing oil or gas, ramping up investment in renewables, and becoming the transformative leader the world is begging for.\" In an attempt to defend his record amid criticism last September, Malpass said the World Bank allocated $31.7 billion to climate finance in 2021, with half of it aimed at bolstering adaptation efforts. Not only is that a tiny fraction of the trillions of dollars in green investment the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is needed each year to maintain a habitable planet, but according to by the , Malpass was directly involved in weakening multilateral development banks' (MDBs) joint announcement on climate lending at COP26. After the World Bank itself last year as \"the of climate investments in developing countries,\" Bronwen Tucker of Oil Change International that \"the World Bank Group still funds more fossil fuels than any other MDB, and they continue to lock Global South countries into expensive and volatile fossil fuel contracts through their heavy-handed policy lending programs.\" The Big Shift Global coalition in a recent report that the World Bank has directly financed at least $14.8 billion in fossil fuel production since the signing of the Paris agreement in 2015\u2014negating its 2017 to stop supporting oil and gas projects within two years. The IPCC and the International Energy Agency have that fossil fuel expansion is with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above preindustrial levels, beyond which the climate emergency's consequences will even deadlier, especially for humanity's poorest members who have done the least to cause the crisis. \u2014 The Big Shift Global (@The Big Shift Global) \"As the World Bank and IMF meet behind closed doors to advance the agenda of concentrated corporate and political power, a coalition of D.C.-area activists in solidarity with movements worldwide, especially in the Global South, manifested a very different vision outside,\" Basav Sen, member of the For People For Planet coalition, said Monday. \"We encircled the meetings on bicycle and on foot, to assert the power of organized people.\" Concerned citizens from around the globe are demonstrating throughout the week to demand that the World Bank stop financing fossil fuels. They also plan to call for an overhaul of both Bretton Woods institutions\u2014the World Bank and the \u2014to \"prioritize justice, helping developing countries to green to follow a 1.5\u00b0C roadmap with poverty alleviation at its heart,\" according to the Glasgow Actions Team. \"They will also call to end the 'gentlemen's agreement' that has thus far allowed only the U.S. to nominate the World Bank president.\" On Tuesday morning, activists held a \"First 100 Days\" protest outside World Bank headquarters. They unveiled a first 100 days checklist that outlines what they want incoming bank president Banga to achieve at the start of his five-year term. Campaigners also plan to gather outside the World Bank on Wednesday for a \"Stop Fossil Gas\" demonstration, where they will draw attention to the bank's continued funding of a worldwide expansion of gas pipelines. Activists plan to cap off the week of action with a large march and rally on Friday that features a \"Trojan Horse\" of debt impacts on low-income nations the World Bank works with.",

                  "description": "BTC price continues to show strength and derivatives data suggests that bulls intend to press Bitcoin higher.",
                  "content": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) price maintained the $30,000 support as lower-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released on April 12. The official inflation rate for March increased 5% year on year, which was slightly less than the 5.1% consensus. It was the lowest reading since May 2021, but is still significantly higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The data suggests that inflation is no longer the driving force behind Bitcoin\u2019s rally and Investors' focus shifted from the impact of inflationary pressure to potential recession risks after the banking crisis revealed how fragile the financial system was following the Federal Reserve's twelve-month hike in interest rates from 0.10% to 4.85%. Aside from the Silicon Valley Bank bankruptcy and the government-backed sale of Credit Suisse to UBS, several warning signs of a macroeconomic downturn have emerged. The most recent ISM Purchasing Managers Index data fell to its lowest level since May 2020, indicating an economic contraction. According to Federal Reserve documents released on April 12, the aftermath of the U.S. banking crisis is likely to push the economy into a \"mild recession\" later this year. Because of the crisis, some have speculated that the Fed will hold off on raising interest rates, but officials affirmed that more effort is needed to keep inflation under control. According to a Moody's Analytics report, commercial real estate prices fell 1.6% in February, the most since the 2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, the national office vacancy rate reached 16.5%, indicating the severity of the economic difficulties that businesses are currently facing. Whatever the reason for Bitcoin's 50% rally between March 11 and April 11, it demonstrates resilience to FUD, including the SEC's Wells Notice against Coinbase on March 22, and the CFTC filing a suit against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao on March 27. By holding the $30,000 support, Bitcoin demonstrates that the positive momentum can continue regardless of whether inflation remains above 5%. Not everyone is cheering the rally, particularly traders who have placed bearish bets using Bitcoin options. The April 14 open interest for BTC options expiry is $950 million, with $490 million in call (buy) options and $460 million in put (sell) options. Bears have been caught off guard, with less than 7% of their bets exceeding $29,000. Below are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of call (buy) and put (sell) options contracts available on April 14 varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit: This rough estimate considers only call options in bullish bets and put options in neutral-to-bearish trades. Nonetheless, this oversimplification excludes more complex investment strategies. A trader, for example, could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a certain price, but this effect is difficult to estimate. Related: Bitcoin-friendly PPI data boosts bulls as Ether price fights for $2K Bulls are expected to push Bitcoin above $30,500 on April 14 at 8:00 a.m UTC to profit an additional $100 million. Bears, on the other hand, would need to pressure Bitcoin's price below $29,000 in order to balance the scales. However, bears have recently suffered significant losses as BTC futures short contracts were forcibly liquidated to the tune of $128 million between April 9 and April 11. As the most likely scenario favors Bitcoin bulls, their profits will most likely be used to reinforce the $30,000 support. Bears might consider licking their wounds and waiting for additional actions from regulators as the macroeconomic scenario is currently bullish for supply capped assets.

                  "description": "The economist, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, spoke at an Economic Club of Chicago luncheon Tuesday.",
                  "content": "Economist Austan Goolsbee, recently named president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, urged caution Tuesday against raising interest rates too aggressively amid financial uncertainty and two high-profile bank failures. Addressing the \u201cnew big hairy elephant in the room\u201d at an Economic Club of Chicago luncheon, Goolsbee said tightening credit conditions in the wake of last month\u2019s collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank can work in tandem with monetary policy to cool inflation. Advertisement \u201cHistory has taught us that at moments of financial stress, even if they don\u2019t escalate into a crisis, they often mean tighter credit conditions and have a material impact on the real economy in a way that the Fed absolutely needs to take into account when setting the monetary policy,\u201d Goolsbee said. Despite the banking turmoil, the Fed raised interest rates for the ninth time in a row last month, a 0.25% hike that boosted the benchmark rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%, up from near zero a year ago. The Fed relies on higher interest rates as its main tool for fighting inflation, which has risen over the last year to an annual rate of 6% in February \u2014 far above the target inflation rate of 2%. Advertisement A longtime economics professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and a former adviser to President Barack Obama, Goolsbee, 53, became the 10th president of the Chicago Fed in January, succeeding Charles Evans, who retired after 15 years. Goolsbee has already voted twice to increase rates, something it took his predecessor eight years to achieve. Goolsbee said that although inflation remains a problem, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank means the Fed may need to adjust monetary policy \u2014 slow down the rate hikes \u2014 if banks pull back on lending to protect their balance sheets. Projected tighter credit at banks may be the equivalent of raising the Fed funds rate by 25 to 75 basis points, he said. \u201cWe should be extra careful about raising rates too aggressively until we see how much work the headwinds are doing for us in getting inflation down,\u201d Goolsbee said. One of 12 regional Reserve Banks, the Chicago Fed district covers Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin. Goolsbee, who was named Washington, D.C.\u2019s funniest celebrity during his tenure in the Obama administration, touched on more than interest rates in his hourlong discussion, citing the unusual circumstances of the economy\u2019s recovery from \u201cbizarro\u201d COVID-19 times. Half-empty office buildings, shifting consumer demand, rising inflation and a strong job market have created a \u201cweird puzzle\u201d for the Fed to solve, he said. Playing to the business leaders in attendance, Goolsbee said Chicago may not have the best winter weather \u2014 or baseball teams \u2014 but its diverse economy is a reason to remain bullish on the city, however the future unfolds. rchannick@chicagotribune.com",

                  "description": "Government should develop Know Your Customer procedures for social media and messaging services and take stronger measures to track cryptocurrency transactions.",
                  "content": "While regulators and policymakers dither and try to decide if cryptocurrencies have a future in the economy, early adopters, including terrorists and violent extremists, are exploiting a law enforcement blind spot. The ease by which money laundering and terrorism financing take place with cryptocurrencies and the more dangerous privacy coins are becoming a security threat of our own making through bureaucratic inaction. The recent indictment of a New York woman accused of sending funds to Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham \u2014 designated by the United States and United Nations as a Foreign Terrorist Organization \u2014 is newsworthy because it\u2019s the exception, not the rule. But this does not necessarily mean that financing terrorism with cryptocurrencies is itself a rare event. Rather, the few prosecutions that have been announced reflect the limitations of law enforcement\u2019s capabilities in the United States and around the world \u2014 a problem that can and should be solved. The U.S. has only a small group of dedicated law enforcement personnel to track and seize cryptocurrencies used for criminal purposes. Agents responsible are also tasked with investigating all aspects of the misuse of cryptocurrencies ranging from extortion and money laundering to sanctions evasion and terrorism financing. This lack of specific focus broadens the potential for misuse of cryptocurrencies to be undetected, particularly in light of the steady migration by criminals to so-called privacy coins that encrypt wallets \u2014 like Monero \u2014 and in some cases also the transactions themselves. Related: CBDCs will lead to absolute government control In June 2020, my own Counter Extremism Project (CEP) located a notorious pro-ISIS website requesting Monero ( XMR ) cryptocurrency donations \u201cbecause it offers more privacy and safety features than Bitcoin.\u201d Months later, a website that supports the National Socialist Order and spreads violent neo-Nazi propaganda requested donations via Monero, and a neo-Nazi chat group on Telegram posted a guide on how to purchase Monero to the dark web. The neo-Nazi accelerationist group The Base, too, has requested cryptocurrency donations in Monero to facilitate training and unspecified equipment. Though the U.S. has the most advanced capacity to track and seize cryptocurrencies used for criminal purposes, these and other privacy coins present technical hurdles that no country has yet fully overcome. Their encryption technology renders law enforcement largely blind to who holds privacy coins and to what end they are used, and its users know it. The availability of so-called decentralized wallets, shareware downloadable from the internet, outside of cryptocurrency exchanges also provides another layer of anonymity by removing a third party that is responsible for fulfilling customer identification obligations and due diligence procedures. In May 2022, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs reported that \u201cthe IRS has had to develop new partnerships with private companies to attempt to develop a tool or solution for tracing Monero transactions\u201d and that \u201cregulators expressed concern over the use of privacy coins, noting that there is a \u2018substantial difference between more transparent cryptocurrency and more opaque transactions.\u2019\u201d Congress, however, has yet to create new regulatory frameworks or fund the development of new technological tools to the technical hurdles facing law enforcement that would ensure that the terrorism financing risks emanating from such privacy-enhancing, but transparency-reducing technologies are appropriately mitigated. In addition to blockchain analysis, officials should contemplate standards for behavior-based transaction monitoring and regulatory requirements for the tech industry to cooperate with law enforcement, given the intertwining use of cryptocurrencies, including privacy coins, with social media, messenger services and crowdfunding platforms. These service providers can and should become part of the first line of defense. Still, the tech industry is unlikely to focus on countering the misuse of its services for the financing of terrorism unless motivated by regulation and compelled by liability risks. Behavior-based monitoring by exchanges focuses on the actions of wallet holders and recognizes patterns that do not fit the usual behavior of users. If such suspicious patterns occur, they are flagged for further inspections to determine whether risks of money laundering, terrorism financing or other financial crimes occur. Exchanges have access to real-time user information that is broader than the information available to traditional financial institutions, which largely rely on information provided by their customers. For this powerful tool to be used more effectively, appropriate regulatory standards should be developed to guide its use by exchanges while adequately protecting user data. Related: Elizabeth Warren is pushing the Senate to ban your crypto wallet Stronger regulatory standards for content monitoring and Know Your Customer procedures for social media, messenger services and crowdfunding platforms are needed when these platforms are used for commercial purposes, such as through web shops or crowdfunding campaigns. These internet platforms presently operate purely on their own non-regulated standards, which presents an uneven defensive mechanism across various platforms and generally very low moderation standards. Noncustodial wallets and exchanges, as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) advises, should be considered high-risk technology. Therefore, their use outside of exchanges should always be considered as a strong indication of nefarious activity. If exchanges choose not to require users that hold noncustodial wallets to fully disclose their identity during a transaction involving such noncustodial wallets, it would be advisable that these exchanges do not process such transactions. Ultimately, only through governmental cooperation with industry stakeholders, combined with effective regulatory standards for the tech and fintech industries, can substantial progress be achieved and the risk of cryptocurrencies and privacy coins being used to fund extremism and terrorism be substantially reduced.

                  "description": "BTC price continues to show strength and derivatives data suggests that bulls intend to press Bitcoin higher.",
                  "content": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) price maintained the $30,000 support as lower-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released on April 12. The official inflation rate for March increased 5% year on year, which was slightly less than the 5.1% consensus. It was the lowest reading since May 2021, but is still significantly higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The data suggests that inflation is no longer the driving force behind Bitcoin\u2019s rally and Investors' focus shifted from the impact of inflationary pressure to potential recession risks after the banking crisis revealed how fragile the financial system was following the Federal Reserve's twelve-month hike in interest rates from 0.10% to 4.85%. Aside from the Silicon Valley Bank bankruptcy and the government-backed sale of Credit Suisse to UBS, several warning signs of a macroeconomic downturn have emerged. The most recent ISM Purchasing Managers Index data fell to its lowest level since May 2020, indicating an economic contraction. According to Federal Reserve documents released on April 12, the aftermath of the U.S. banking crisis is likely to push the economy into a \"mild recession\" later this year. Because of the crisis, some have speculated that the Fed will hold off on raising interest rates, but officials affirmed that more effort is needed to keep inflation under control. According to a Moody's Analytics report, commercial real estate prices fell 1.6% in February, the most since the 2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, the national office vacancy rate reached 16.5%, indicating the severity of the economic difficulties that businesses are currently facing. Whatever the reason for Bitcoin's 50% rally between March 11 and April 11, it demonstrates resilience to FUD, including the SEC's Wells Notice against Coinbase on March 22, and the CFTC filing a suit against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao on March 27. By holding the $30,000 support, Bitcoin demonstrates that the positive momentum can continue regardless of whether inflation remains above 5%. Not everyone is cheering the rally, particularly traders who have placed bearish bets using Bitcoin options. The April 14 open interest for BTC options expiry is $950 million, with $490 million in call (buy) options and $460 million in put (sell) options. Bears have been caught off guard, with less than 7% of their bets exceeding $29,000. Below are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of call (buy) and put (sell) options contracts available on April 14 varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit: This rough estimate considers only call options in bullish bets and put options in neutral-to-bearish trades. Nonetheless, this oversimplification excludes more complex investment strategies. A trader, for example, could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a certain price, but this effect is difficult to estimate. Related: Bitcoin-friendly PPI data boosts bulls as Ether price fights for $2K Bulls are expected to push Bitcoin above $30,500 on April 14 at 8:00 a.m UTC to profit an additional $100 million. Bears, on the other hand, would need to pressure Bitcoin's price below $29,000 in order to balance the scales. However, bears have recently suffered significant losses as BTC futures short contracts were forcibly liquidated to the tune of $128 million between April 9 and April 11. As the most likely scenario favors Bitcoin bulls, their profits will most likely be used to reinforce the $30,000 support. Bears might consider licking their wounds and waiting for additional actions from regulators as the macroeconomic scenario is currently bullish for supply capped assets.

                  "content": "Economist Austan Goolsbee, recently named president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, urged caution Tuesday against raising interest rates too aggressively amid financial uncertainty and two high-profile bank failures. Addressing the \u201cnew big hairy elephant in the room\u201d at an Economic Club of Chicago luncheon, Goolsbee said tightening credit conditions in the wake of last month\u2019s collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank can work in tandem with monetary policy to cool inflation. Advertisement \u201cHistory has taught us that at moments of financial stress, even if they don\u2019t escalate into a crisis, they often mean tighter credit conditions and have a material impact on the real economy in a way that the Fed absolutely needs to take into account when setting the monetary policy,\u201d Goolsbee said. Despite the banking turmoil, the Fed raised interest rates for the ninth time in a row last month, a 0.25% hike that boosted the benchmark rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%, up from near zero a year ago. The Fed relies on higher interest rates as its main tool for fighting inflation, which has risen over the last year to an annual rate of 6% in February \u2014 far above the target inflation rate of 2%. Advertisement A longtime economics professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and a former adviser to President Barack Obama, Goolsbee, 53, became the 10th president of the Chicago Fed in January, succeeding Charles Evans, who retired after 15 years. Goolsbee has already voted twice to increase rates, something it took his predecessor eight years to achieve. Goolsbee said that although inflation remains a problem, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank means the Fed may need to adjust monetary policy \u2014 slow down the rate hikes \u2014 if banks pull back on lending to protect their balance sheets. Projected tighter credit at banks may be the equivalent of raising the Fed funds rate by 25 to 75 basis points, he said. \u201cWe should be extra careful about raising rates too aggressively until we see how much work the headwinds are doing for us in getting inflation down,\u201d Goolsbee said. One of 12 regional Reserve Banks, the Chicago Fed district covers Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin. Goolsbee, who was named Washington, D.C.\u2019s funniest celebrity during his tenure in the Obama administration, touched on more than interest rates in his hourlong discussion, citing the unusual circumstances of the economy\u2019s recovery from \u201cbizarro\u201d COVID-19 times. Half-empty office buildings, shifting consumer demand, rising inflation and a strong job market have created a \u201cweird puzzle\u201d for the Fed to solve, he said. Playing to the business leaders in attendance, Goolsbee said Chicago may not have the best winter weather \u2014 or baseball teams \u2014 but its diverse economy is a reason to remain bullish on the city, however the future unfolds. rchannick@chicagotribune.com",

                  "description": "Government should develop Know Your Customer procedures for social media and messaging services and take stronger measures to track cryptocurrency transactions.",
                  "content": "While regulators and policymakers dither and try to decide if cryptocurrencies have a future in the economy, early adopters, including terrorists and violent extremists, are exploiting a law enforcement blind spot. The ease by which money laundering and terrorism financing take place with cryptocurrencies and the more dangerous privacy coins are becoming a security threat of our own making through bureaucratic inaction. The recent indictment of a New York woman accused of sending funds to Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham \u2014 designated by the United States and United Nations as a Foreign Terrorist Organization \u2014 is newsworthy because it\u2019s the exception, not the rule. But this does not necessarily mean that financing terrorism with cryptocurrencies is itself a rare event. Rather, the few prosecutions that have been announced reflect the limitations of law enforcement\u2019s capabilities in the United States and around the world \u2014 a problem that can and should be solved. The U.S. has only a small group of dedicated law enforcement personnel to track and seize cryptocurrencies used for criminal purposes. Agents responsible are also tasked with investigating all aspects of the misuse of cryptocurrencies ranging from extortion and money laundering to sanctions evasion and terrorism financing. This lack of specific focus broadens the potential for misuse of cryptocurrencies to be undetected, particularly in light of the steady migration by criminals to so-called privacy coins that encrypt wallets \u2014 like Monero \u2014 and in some cases also the transactions themselves. Related: CBDCs will lead to absolute government control In June 2020, my own Counter Extremism Project (CEP) located a notorious pro-ISIS website requesting Monero ( XMR ) cryptocurrency donations \u201cbecause it offers more privacy and safety features than Bitcoin.\u201d Months later, a website that supports the National Socialist Order and spreads violent neo-Nazi propaganda requested donations via Monero, and a neo-Nazi chat group on Telegram posted a guide on how to purchase Monero to the dark web. The neo-Nazi accelerationist group The Base, too, has requested cryptocurrency donations in Monero to facilitate training and unspecified equipment. Though the U.S. has the most advanced capacity to track and seize cryptocurrencies used for criminal purposes, these and other privacy coins present technical hurdles that no country has yet fully overcome. Their encryption technology renders law enforcement largely blind to who holds privacy coins and to what end they are used, and its users know it. The availability of so-called decentralized wallets, shareware downloadable from the internet, outside of cryptocurrency exchanges also provides another layer of anonymity by removing a third party that is responsible for fulfilling customer identification obligations and due diligence procedures. In May 2022, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs reported that \u201cthe IRS has had to develop new partnerships with private companies to attempt to develop a tool or solution for tracing Monero transactions\u201d and that \u201cregulators expressed concern over the use of privacy coins, noting that there is a \u2018substantial difference between more transparent cryptocurrency and more opaque transactions.\u2019\u201d Congress, however, has yet to create new regulatory frameworks or fund the development of new technological tools to the technical hurdles facing law enforcement that would ensure that the terrorism financing risks emanating from such privacy-enhancing, but transparency-reducing technologies are appropriately mitigated. In addition to blockchain analysis, officials should contemplate standards for behavior-based transaction monitoring and regulatory requirements for the tech industry to cooperate with law enforcement, given the intertwining use of cryptocurrencies, including privacy coins, with social media, messenger services and crowdfunding platforms. These service providers can and should become part of the first line of defense. Still, the tech industry is unlikely to focus on countering the misuse of its services for the financing of terrorism unless motivated by regulation and compelled by liability risks. Behavior-based monitoring by exchanges focuses on the actions of wallet holders and recognizes patterns that do not fit the usual behavior of users. If such suspicious patterns occur, they are flagged for further inspections to determine whether risks of money laundering, terrorism financing or other financial crimes occur. Exchanges have access to real-time user information that is broader than the information available to traditional financial institutions, which largely rely on information provided by their customers. For this powerful tool to be used more effectively, appropriate regulatory standards should be developed to guide its use by exchanges while adequately protecting user data. Related: Elizabeth Warren is pushing the Senate to ban your crypto wallet Stronger regulatory standards for content monitoring and Know Your Customer procedures for social media, messenger services and crowdfunding platforms are needed when these platforms are used for commercial purposes, such as through web shops or crowdfunding campaigns. These internet platforms presently operate purely on their own non-regulated standards, which presents an uneven defensive mechanism across various platforms and generally very low moderation standards. Noncustodial wallets and exchanges, as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) advises, should be considered high-risk technology. Therefore, their use outside of exchanges should always be considered as a strong indication of nefarious activity. If exchanges choose not to require users that hold noncustodial wallets to fully disclose their identity during a transaction involving such noncustodial wallets, it would be advisable that these exchanges do not process such transactions. Ultimately, only through governmental cooperation with industry stakeholders, combined with effective regulatory standards for the tech and fintech industries, can substantial progress be achieved and the risk of cryptocurrencies and privacy coins being used to fund extremism and terrorism be substantially reduced.

                  "description": "BTC price continues to show strength and derivatives data suggests that bulls intend to press Bitcoin higher.",
                  "content": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) price maintained the $30,000 support as lower-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released on April 12. The official inflation rate for March increased 5% year on year, which was slightly less than the 5.1% consensus. It was the lowest reading since May 2021, but is still significantly higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The data suggests that inflation is no longer the driving force behind Bitcoin\u2019s rally and Investors' focus shifted from the impact of inflationary pressure to potential recession risks after the banking crisis revealed how fragile the financial system was following the Federal Reserve's twelve-month hike in interest rates from 0.10% to 4.85%. Aside from the Silicon Valley Bank bankruptcy and the government-backed sale of Credit Suisse to UBS, several warning signs of a macroeconomic downturn have emerged. The most recent ISM Purchasing Managers Index data fell to its lowest level since May 2020, indicating an economic contraction. According to Federal Reserve documents released on April 12, the aftermath of the U.S. banking crisis is likely to push the economy into a \"mild recession\" later this year. Because of the crisis, some have speculated that the Fed will hold off on raising interest rates, but officials affirmed that more effort is needed to keep inflation under control. According to a Moody's Analytics report, commercial real estate prices fell 1.6% in February, the most since the 2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, the national office vacancy rate reached 16.5%, indicating the severity of the economic difficulties that businesses are currently facing. Whatever the reason for Bitcoin's 50% rally between March 11 and April 11, it demonstrates resilience to FUD, including the SEC's Wells Notice against Coinbase on March 22, and the CFTC filing a suit against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao on March 27. By holding the $30,000 support, Bitcoin demonstrates that the positive momentum can continue regardless of whether inflation remains above 5%. Not everyone is cheering the rally, particularly traders who have placed bearish bets using Bitcoin options. The April 14 open interest for BTC options expiry is $950 million, with $490 million in call (buy) options and $460 million in put (sell) options. Bears have been caught off guard, with less than 7% of their bets exceeding $29,000. Below are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of call (buy) and put (sell) options contracts available on April 14 varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit: This rough estimate considers only call options in bullish bets and put options in neutral-to-bearish trades. Nonetheless, this oversimplification excludes more complex investment strategies. A trader, for example, could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a certain price, but this effect is difficult to estimate. Related: Bitcoin-friendly PPI data boosts bulls as Ether price fights for $2K Bulls are expected to push Bitcoin above $30,500 on April 14 at 8:00 a.m UTC to profit an additional $100 million. Bears, on the other hand, would need to pressure Bitcoin's price below $29,000 in order to balance the scales. However, bears have recently suffered significant losses as BTC futures short contracts were forcibly liquidated to the tune of $128 million between April 9 and April 11. As the most likely scenario favors Bitcoin bulls, their profits will most likely be used to reinforce the $30,000 support. Bears might consider licking their wounds and waiting for additional actions from regulators as the macroeconomic scenario is currently bullish for supply capped assets.

                  "description": "The economist, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, spoke at an Economic Club of Chicago luncheon Tuesday.",
                  "content": "Economist Austan Goolsbee, recently named president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, urged caution Tuesday against raising interest rates too aggressively amid financial uncertainty and two high-profile bank failures. Addressing the \u201cnew big hairy elephant in the room\u201d at an Economic Club of Chicago luncheon, Goolsbee said tightening credit conditions in the wake of last month\u2019s collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank can work in tandem with monetary policy to cool inflation. Advertisement \u201cHistory has taught us that at moments of financial stress, even if they don\u2019t escalate into a crisis, they often mean tighter credit conditions and have a material impact on the real economy in a way that the Fed absolutely needs to take into account when setting the monetary policy,\u201d Goolsbee said. Despite the banking turmoil, the Fed raised interest rates for the ninth time in a row last month, a 0.25% hike that boosted the benchmark rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%, up from near zero a year ago. The Fed relies on higher interest rates as its main tool for fighting inflation, which has risen over the last year to an annual rate of 6% in February \u2014 far above the target inflation rate of 2%. Advertisement A longtime economics professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and a former adviser to President Barack Obama, Goolsbee, 53, became the 10th president of the Chicago Fed in January, succeeding Charles Evans, who retired after 15 years. Goolsbee has already voted twice to increase rates, something it took his predecessor eight years to achieve. Goolsbee said that although inflation remains a problem, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank means the Fed may need to adjust monetary policy \u2014 slow down the rate hikes \u2014 if banks pull back on lending to protect their balance sheets. Projected tighter credit at banks may be the equivalent of raising the Fed funds rate by 25 to 75 basis points, he said. \u201cWe should be extra careful about raising rates too aggressively until we see how much work the headwinds are doing for us in getting inflation down,\u201d Goolsbee said. One of 12 regional Reserve Banks, the Chicago Fed district covers Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin. Goolsbee, who was named Washington, D.C.\u2019s funniest celebrity during his tenure in the Obama administration, touched on more than interest rates in his hourlong discussion, citing the unusual circumstances of the economy\u2019s recovery from \u201cbizarro\u201d COVID-19 times. Half-empty office buildings, shifting consumer demand, rising inflation and a strong job market have created a \u201cweird puzzle\u201d for the Fed to solve, he said. Playing to the business leaders in attendance, Goolsbee said Chicago may not have the best winter weather \u2014 or baseball teams \u2014 but its diverse economy is a reason to remain bullish on the city, however the future unfolds. rchannick@chicagotribune.com",

                  "description": "Government should develop Know Your Customer procedures for social media and messaging services and take stronger measures to track cryptocurrency transactions.",
                  "content": "While regulators and policymakers dither and try to decide if cryptocurrencies have a future in the economy, early adopters, including terrorists and violent extremists, are exploiting a law enforcement blind spot. The ease by which money laundering and terrorism financing take place with cryptocurrencies and the more dangerous privacy coins are becoming a security threat of our own making through bureaucratic inaction. The recent indictment of a New York woman accused of sending funds to Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham \u2014 designated by the United States and United Nations as a Foreign Terrorist Organization \u2014 is newsworthy because it\u2019s the exception, not the rule. But this does not necessarily mean that financing terrorism with cryptocurrencies is itself a rare event. Rather, the few prosecutions that have been announced reflect the limitations of law enforcement\u2019s capabilities in the United States and around the world \u2014 a problem that can and should be solved. The U.S. has only a small group of dedicated law enforcement personnel to track and seize cryptocurrencies used for criminal purposes. Agents responsible are also tasked with investigating all aspects of the misuse of cryptocurrencies ranging from extortion and money laundering to sanctions evasion and terrorism financing. This lack of specific focus broadens the potential for misuse of cryptocurrencies to be undetected, particularly in light of the steady migration by criminals to so-called privacy coins that encrypt wallets \u2014 like Monero \u2014 and in some cases also the transactions themselves. Related: CBDCs will lead to absolute government control In June 2020, my own Counter Extremism Project (CEP) located a notorious pro-ISIS website requesting Monero ( XMR ) cryptocurrency donations \u201cbecause it offers more privacy and safety features than Bitcoin.\u201d Months later, a website that supports the National Socialist Order and spreads violent neo-Nazi propaganda requested donations via Monero, and a neo-Nazi chat group on Telegram posted a guide on how to purchase Monero to the dark web. The neo-Nazi accelerationist group The Base, too, has requested cryptocurrency donations in Monero to facilitate training and unspecified equipment. Though the U.S. has the most advanced capacity to track and seize cryptocurrencies used for criminal purposes, these and other privacy coins present technical hurdles that no country has yet fully overcome. Their encryption technology renders law enforcement largely blind to who holds privacy coins and to what end they are used, and its users know it. The availability of so-called decentralized wallets, shareware downloadable from the internet, outside of cryptocurrency exchanges also provides another layer of anonymity by removing a third party that is responsible for fulfilling customer identification obligations and due diligence procedures. In May 2022, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs reported that \u201cthe IRS has had to develop new partnerships with private companies to attempt to develop a tool or solution for tracing Monero transactions\u201d and that \u201cregulators expressed concern over the use of privacy coins, noting that there is a \u2018substantial difference between more transparent cryptocurrency and more opaque transactions.\u2019\u201d Congress, however, has yet to create new regulatory frameworks or fund the development of new technological tools to the technical hurdles facing law enforcement that would ensure that the terrorism financing risks emanating from such privacy-enhancing, but transparency-reducing technologies are appropriately mitigated. In addition to blockchain analysis, officials should contemplate standards for behavior-based transaction monitoring and regulatory requirements for the tech industry to cooperate with law enforcement, given the intertwining use of cryptocurrencies, including privacy coins, with social media, messenger services and crowdfunding platforms. These service providers can and should become part of the first line of defense. Still, the tech industry is unlikely to focus on countering the misuse of its services for the financing of terrorism unless motivated by regulation and compelled by liability risks. Behavior-based monitoring by exchanges focuses on the actions of wallet holders and recognizes patterns that do not fit the usual behavior of users. If such suspicious patterns occur, they are flagged for further inspections to determine whether risks of money laundering, terrorism financing or other financial crimes occur. Exchanges have access to real-time user information that is broader than the information available to traditional financial institutions, which largely rely on information provided by their customers. For this powerful tool to be used more effectively, appropriate regulatory standards should be developed to guide its use by exchanges while adequately protecting user data. Related: Elizabeth Warren is pushing the Senate to ban your crypto wallet Stronger regulatory standards for content monitoring and Know Your Customer procedures for social media, messenger services and crowdfunding platforms are needed when these platforms are used for commercial purposes, such as through web shops or crowdfunding campaigns. These internet platforms presently operate purely on their own non-regulated standards, which presents an uneven defensive mechanism across various platforms and generally very low moderation standards. Noncustodial wallets and exchanges, as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) advises, should be considered high-risk technology. Therefore, their use outside of exchanges should always be considered as a strong indication of nefarious activity. If exchanges choose not to require users that hold noncustodial wallets to fully disclose their identity during a transaction involving such noncustodial wallets, it would be advisable that these exchanges do not process such transactions. Ultimately, only through governmental cooperation with industry stakeholders, combined with effective regulatory standards for the tech and fintech industries, can substantial progress be achieved and the risk of cryptocurrencies and privacy coins being used to fund extremism and terrorism be substantially reduced.

                  "description": "BTC price continues to show strength and derivatives data suggests that bulls intend to press Bitcoin higher.",
                  "content": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) price maintained the $30,000 support as lower-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released on April 12. The official inflation rate for March increased 5% year on year, which was slightly less than the 5.1% consensus. It was the lowest reading since May 2021, but is still significantly higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The data suggests that inflation is no longer the driving force behind Bitcoin\u2019s rally and Investors' focus shifted from the impact of inflationary pressure to potential recession risks after the banking crisis revealed how fragile the financial system was following the Federal Reserve's twelve-month hike in interest rates from 0.10% to 4.85%. Aside from the Silicon Valley Bank bankruptcy and the government-backed sale of Credit Suisse to UBS, several warning signs of a macroeconomic downturn have emerged. The most recent ISM Purchasing Managers Index data fell to its lowest level since May 2020, indicating an economic contraction. According to Federal Reserve documents released on April 12, the aftermath of the U.S. banking crisis is likely to push the economy into a \"mild recession\" later this year. Because of the crisis, some have speculated that the Fed will hold off on raising interest rates, but officials affirmed that more effort is needed to keep inflation under control. According to a Moody's Analytics report, commercial real estate prices fell 1.6% in February, the most since the 2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, the national office vacancy rate reached 16.5%, indicating the severity of the economic difficulties that businesses are currently facing. Whatever the reason for Bitcoin's 50% rally between March 11 and April 11, it demonstrates resilience to FUD, including the SEC's Wells Notice against Coinbase on March 22, and the CFTC filing a suit against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao on March 27. By holding the $30,000 support, Bitcoin demonstrates that the positive momentum can continue regardless of whether inflation remains above 5%. Not everyone is cheering the rally, particularly traders who have placed bearish bets using Bitcoin options. The April 14 open interest for BTC options expiry is $950 million, with $490 million in call (buy) options and $460 million in put (sell) options. Bears have been caught off guard, with less than 7% of their bets exceeding $29,000. Below are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of call (buy) and put (sell) options contracts available on April 14 varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit: This rough estimate considers only call options in bullish bets and put options in neutral-to-bearish trades. Nonetheless, this oversimplification excludes more complex investment strategies. A trader, for example, could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a certain price, but this effect is difficult to estimate. Related: Bitcoin-friendly PPI data boosts bulls as Ether price fights for $2K Bulls are expected to push Bitcoin above $30,500 on April 14 at 8:00 a.m UTC to profit an additional $100 million. Bears, on the other hand, would need to pressure Bitcoin's price below $29,000 in order to balance the scales. However, bears have recently suffered significant losses as BTC futures short contracts were forcibly liquidated to the tune of $128 million between April 9 and April 11. As the most likely scenario favors Bitcoin bulls, their profits will most likely be used to reinforce the $30,000 support. Bears might consider licking their wounds and waiting for additional actions from regulators as the macroeconomic scenario is currently bullish for supply capped assets.

                  "content": "Economist Austan Goolsbee, recently named president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, urged caution Tuesday against raising interest rates too aggressively amid financial uncertainty and two high-profile bank failures. Addressing the \u201cnew big hairy elephant in the room\u201d at an Economic Club of Chicago luncheon, Goolsbee said tightening credit conditions in the wake of last month\u2019s collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank can work in tandem with monetary policy to cool inflation. Advertisement \u201cHistory has taught us that at moments of financial stress, even if they don\u2019t escalate into a crisis, they often mean tighter credit conditions and have a material impact on the real economy in a way that the Fed absolutely needs to take into account when setting the monetary policy,\u201d Goolsbee said. Despite the banking turmoil, the Fed raised interest rates for the ninth time in a row last month, a 0.25% hike that boosted the benchmark rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%, up from near zero a year ago. The Fed relies on higher interest rates as its main tool for fighting inflation, which has risen over the last year to an annual rate of 6% in February \u2014 far above the target inflation rate of 2%. Advertisement A longtime economics professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and a former adviser to President Barack Obama, Goolsbee, 53, became the 10th president of the Chicago Fed in January, succeeding Charles Evans, who retired after 15 years. Goolsbee has already voted twice to increase rates, something it took his predecessor eight years to achieve. Goolsbee said that although inflation remains a problem, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank means the Fed may need to adjust monetary policy \u2014 slow down the rate hikes \u2014 if banks pull back on lending to protect their balance sheets. Projected tighter credit at banks may be the equivalent of raising the Fed funds rate by 25 to 75 basis points, he said. \u201cWe should be extra careful about raising rates too aggressively until we see how much work the headwinds are doing for us in getting inflation down,\u201d Goolsbee said. One of 12 regional Reserve Banks, the Chicago Fed district covers Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin. Goolsbee, who was named Washington, D.C.\u2019s funniest celebrity during his tenure in the Obama administration, touched on more than interest rates in his hourlong discussion, citing the unusual circumstances of the economy\u2019s recovery from \u201cbizarro\u201d COVID-19 times. Half-empty office buildings, shifting consumer demand, rising inflation and a strong job market have created a \u201cweird puzzle\u201d for the Fed to solve, he said. Playing to the business leaders in attendance, Goolsbee said Chicago may not have the best winter weather \u2014 or baseball teams \u2014 but its diverse economy is a reason to remain bullish on the city, however the future unfolds. rchannick@chicagotribune.com",

                  "description": "Government should develop Know Your Customer procedures for social media and messaging services and take stronger measures to track cryptocurrency transactions.",
                  "content": "While regulators and policymakers dither and try to decide if cryptocurrencies have a future in the economy, early adopters, including terrorists and violent extremists, are exploiting a law enforcement blind spot. The ease by which money laundering and terrorism financing take place with cryptocurrencies and the more dangerous privacy coins are becoming a security threat of our own making through bureaucratic inaction. The recent indictment of a New York woman accused of sending funds to Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham \u2014 designated by the United States and United Nations as a Foreign Terrorist Organization \u2014 is newsworthy because it\u2019s the exception, not the rule. But this does not necessarily mean that financing terrorism with cryptocurrencies is itself a rare event. Rather, the few prosecutions that have been announced reflect the limitations of law enforcement\u2019s capabilities in the United States and around the world \u2014 a problem that can and should be solved. The U.S. has only a small group of dedicated law enforcement personnel to track and seize cryptocurrencies used for criminal purposes. Agents responsible are also tasked with investigating all aspects of the misuse of cryptocurrencies ranging from extortion and money laundering to sanctions evasion and terrorism financing. This lack of specific focus broadens the potential for misuse of cryptocurrencies to be undetected, particularly in light of the steady migration by criminals to so-called privacy coins that encrypt wallets \u2014 like Monero \u2014 and in some cases also the transactions themselves. Related: CBDCs will lead to absolute government control In June 2020, my own Counter Extremism Project (CEP) located a notorious pro-ISIS website requesting Monero ( XMR ) cryptocurrency donations \u201cbecause it offers more privacy and safety features than Bitcoin.\u201d Months later, a website that supports the National Socialist Order and spreads violent neo-Nazi propaganda requested donations via Monero, and a neo-Nazi chat group on Telegram posted a guide on how to purchase Monero to the dark web. The neo-Nazi accelerationist group The Base, too, has requested cryptocurrency donations in Monero to facilitate training and unspecified equipment. Though the U.S. has the most advanced capacity to track and seize cryptocurrencies used for criminal purposes, these and other privacy coins present technical hurdles that no country has yet fully overcome. Their encryption technology renders law enforcement largely blind to who holds privacy coins and to what end they are used, and its users know it. The availability of so-called decentralized wallets, shareware downloadable from the internet, outside of cryptocurrency exchanges also provides another layer of anonymity by removing a third party that is responsible for fulfilling customer identification obligations and due diligence procedures. In May 2022, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs reported that \u201cthe IRS has had to develop new partnerships with private companies to attempt to develop a tool or solution for tracing Monero transactions\u201d and that \u201cregulators expressed concern over the use of privacy coins, noting that there is a \u2018substantial difference between more transparent cryptocurrency and more opaque transactions.\u2019\u201d Congress, however, has yet to create new regulatory frameworks or fund the development of new technological tools to the technical hurdles facing law enforcement that would ensure that the terrorism financing risks emanating from such privacy-enhancing, but transparency-reducing technologies are appropriately mitigated. In addition to blockchain analysis, officials should contemplate standards for behavior-based transaction monitoring and regulatory requirements for the tech industry to cooperate with law enforcement, given the intertwining use of cryptocurrencies, including privacy coins, with social media, messenger services and crowdfunding platforms. These service providers can and should become part of the first line of defense. Still, the tech industry is unlikely to focus on countering the misuse of its services for the financing of terrorism unless motivated by regulation and compelled by liability risks. Behavior-based monitoring by exchanges focuses on the actions of wallet holders and recognizes patterns that do not fit the usual behavior of users. If such suspicious patterns occur, they are flagged for further inspections to determine whether risks of money laundering, terrorism financing or other financial crimes occur. Exchanges have access to real-time user information that is broader than the information available to traditional financial institutions, which largely rely on information provided by their customers. For this powerful tool to be used more effectively, appropriate regulatory standards should be developed to guide its use by exchanges while adequately protecting user data. Related: Elizabeth Warren is pushing the Senate to ban your crypto wallet Stronger regulatory standards for content monitoring and Know Your Customer procedures for social media, messenger services and crowdfunding platforms are needed when these platforms are used for commercial purposes, such as through web shops or crowdfunding campaigns. These internet platforms presently operate purely on their own non-regulated standards, which presents an uneven defensive mechanism across various platforms and generally very low moderation standards. Noncustodial wallets and exchanges, as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) advises, should be considered high-risk technology. Therefore, their use outside of exchanges should always be considered as a strong indication of nefarious activity. If exchanges choose not to require users that hold noncustodial wallets to fully disclose their identity during a transaction involving such noncustodial wallets, it would be advisable that these exchanges do not process such transactions. Ultimately, only through governmental cooperation with industry stakeholders, combined with effective regulatory standards for the tech and fintech industries, can substantial progress be achieved and the risk of cryptocurrencies and privacy coins being used to fund extremism and terrorism be substantially reduced.

                  "content": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) price maintained the $30,000 support as lower-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released on April 12. The official inflation rate for March increased 5% year on year, which was slightly less than the 5.1% consensus. It was the lowest reading since May 2021, but is still significantly higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The data suggests that inflation is no longer the driving force behind Bitcoin\u2019s rally and Investors' focus shifted from the impact of inflationary pressure to potential recession risks after the banking crisis revealed how fragile the financial system was following the Federal Reserve's twelve-month hike in interest rates from 0.10% to 4.85%. Aside from the Silicon Valley Bank bankruptcy and the government-backed sale of Credit Suisse to UBS, several warning signs of a macroeconomic downturn have emerged. The most recent ISM Purchasing Managers Index data fell to its lowest level since May 2020, indicating an economic contraction. According to Federal Reserve documents released on April 12, the aftermath of the U.S. banking crisis is likely to push the economy into a \"mild recession\" later this year. Because of the crisis, some have speculated that the Fed will hold off on raising interest rates, but officials affirmed that more effort is needed to keep inflation under control. According to a Moody's Analytics report, commercial real estate prices fell 1.6% in February, the most since the 2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, the national office vacancy rate reached 16.5%, indicating the severity of the economic difficulties that businesses are currently facing. Whatever the reason for Bitcoin's 50% rally between March 11 and April 11, it demonstrates resilience to FUD, including the SEC's Wells Notice against Coinbase on March 22, and the CFTC filing a suit against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao on March 27. By holding the $30,000 support, Bitcoin demonstrates that the positive momentum can continue regardless of whether inflation remains above 5%. Not everyone is cheering the rally, particularly traders who have placed bearish bets using Bitcoin options. The April 14 open interest for BTC options expiry is $950 million, with $490 million in call (buy) options and $460 million in put (sell) options. Bears have been caught off guard, with less than 7% of their bets exceeding $29,000. Below are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of call (buy) and put (sell) options contracts available on April 14 varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit: This rough estimate considers only call options in bullish bets and put options in neutral-to-bearish trades. Nonetheless, this oversimplification excludes more complex investment strategies. A trader, for example, could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a certain price, but this effect is difficult to estimate. Related: Bitcoin-friendly PPI data boosts bulls as Ether price fights for $2K Bulls are expected to push Bitcoin above $30,500 on April 14 at 8:00 a.m UTC to profit an additional $100 million. Bears, on the other hand, would need to pressure Bitcoin's price below $29,000 in order to balance the scales. However, bears have recently suffered significant losses as BTC futures short contracts were forcibly liquidated to the tune of $128 million between April 9 and April 11. As the most likely scenario favors Bitcoin bulls, their profits will most likely be used to reinforce the $30,000 support. Bears might consider licking their wounds and waiting for additional actions from regulators as the macroeconomic scenario is currently bullish for supply capped assets.

                  "content": "By Elijah Asdourian, James Lee, Nasiha Salwati, Louise SheinerWhat\u2019s the latest thinking in fiscal and monetary policy? The Hutchins Roundup keeps you informed of the latest research, charts, and speeches. Want to receive the Hutchins Roundup as an email? Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday. Men, but not women, leave school when short-term earnings opportunities arise J\u00f3sef Sigurdsson of Stockholm University finds that a change to the Icelandic tax code led men to drop out of school without similarly affecting women. Iceland collected no income tax on earnings in 1987 as it changed its national taxation system, creating an opportunity for Icelanders to earn substantially more in the short term. Dropout rates for men who were just old enough to leave high school and start working were 5 percentage points higher than for men just below the cutoff, while dropout rates for women were unchanged. Dropouts rarely returned to school and suffered large losses in lifetime income despite higher earnings in the years after 1987. The findings indicate that short-term earnings opportunities affect men and women differently, suggesting \u201cgender differences in nonpecuniary costs of school attendance, myopia, or perceived returns to education.\u201d The tradeoff between inflation and labor market slack is higher in tight labor markets Using U.S. industry-level data over the 1959 to 2022 period, Simon C. Smith of the Federal Reserve Board, Allan Timmermann of the University of California, San Diego, and Jonathan H. Wright of Johns Hopkins University find that the Phillips Curve \u2013 the relationship between inflation and labor market slack \u2013 steepened in 1972 (meaning that inflation became more sensitive to slack) and flattened in 2001. The flattening was more pronounced for goods prices than service prices and concentrated in metropolitan areas with higher rates of import penetration from China. The authors also find that the Phillips Curve is nonlinear and steeper when the labor market is tight. A steeper Phillips Curve and a higher natural rate of unemployment can explain about half of the surge in prices over the 2020-2022 period, they find. Breaks in the slope of the Phillips Curve make pre-break data less informative for policymakers, causing them to be less certain about the relationship between the unemployment gap and inflation. To compensate for this additional caution, policymakers \u201crespond less aggressively to deviations in the unemployment gap but, conversely, respond more aggressively to deviations from target inflation,\u201d the authors say. China\u2019s growing role in cross-border rescue lending China\u2019s role as an international lender of last resort has grown exponentially in recent years, according to Sebastian Horn of the World Bank and co-authors. Since 2000, more than 20 debtor countries \u2014 primarily debtors of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative \u2014 have received $240 billion USD from the People\u2019s Bank of China in rescue lending \u2014 $170 billion USD via a global swap line that is quickly growing, and $70 billion USD in rescue loans for balance of payments support. Of this, $185 billion USD was lent between 2016 and 2021. China\u2019s overseas lending, the authors say, is making the international financial system more multipolar, less institutionalized, and less transparent. Chart of the week: Core services inflation remains high Chart courtesy of Jason Furman Quote of the week: \u201cWith financial instability contained, monetary policy should remain focused on bringing inflation down, but stand ready to quickly adjust to financial developments. A silver lining is that the banking turmoil will help slow aggregate activity as banks curtail lending. In and of itself, this should partially mitigate the need for further monetary tightening to achieve the same policy stance. But any expectation that central banks will prematurely surrender the inflation fight would have the opposite effect: lowering yields, supporting activity beyond what is warranted, and ultimately complicating the task of monetary authorities. Fiscal policy can also play an active role. By cooling off economic activity, tighter fiscal policy would support monetary policy, allowing real interest rates to return faster to a low natural level. Appropriately designed fiscal consolidation will also help rebuild much needed buffers and help strengthen financial stability. While fiscal policy is turning less expansionary in many countries this year, more could be done to regain fiscal space,\u201d says Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Economic Counsellor of the International Monetary Fund. \u201cOur latest projections also indicate an overall slowdown in medium-term growth forecasts. Five-year ahead growth projections declined steadily from 4.6% in 2011 to 3% in 2023. Some of this decline reflects the growth slowdown of previously rapidly growing economies such as China or Korea. This is predictable: growth slows down as countries converge. But some of the more recent slowdown may also reflect more ominous forces: the scarring impact of the pandemic, a slower pace of structural reforms, as well as the rising and increasingly real threat of geoeconomic fragmentation leading to more trade tensions, less direct investment, and a slower pace of innovation and technology adoption across fragmented \u2018blocks.\u2019 A fragmented world is unlikely to achieve progress for all, or to successfully tackle global challenges such as climate change or pandemic preparedness. We must avoid that path at all costs.\u201d The Brookings Institution is financed through the support of a diverse array of foundations, corporations, governments, individuals, as well as an endowment.

                  "content": "By David Kiron, Elizabeth J. Altman, Christoph RiedlCompanies increasingly rely on an extended workforce (e.g., contractors, gig workers, professional service firms, complementor organizations, and technologies such as algorithmic management and artificial intelligence) to achieve strategic goals and objectives.1 When we ask leaders to describe how they define their workforce today, they mention a diverse array of participants, beyond just full- and part-time employees, all contributing in various ways. Many of these leaders observe that their extended workforce now comprises 30-50% of their entire workforce. For example, Novartis has approximately 100,000 employees and counts more than 50,000 other workers as external contributors.2 Businesses are also increasingly using crowdsourcing platforms to engage external participants in the development of products and services.34 Managers are thinking about their workforce in terms of who contributes to outcomes, not just by workers\u2019 employment arrangements.5 Our ongoing research on workforce ecosystems demonstrates that managing work across organizational boundaries with groups of interdependent actors in a variety of employment relationships creates new opportunities and risks for both workers and businesses.6 These are not subtle shifts. We define a workforce ecosystem as:7 A structure that encompasses actors, from within the organization and beyond, working to create value for an organization. Within the ecosystem, actors work toward individual and collective goals with interdependencies and complementarities among the participants. The emergence of workforce ecosystems has implications for management theory, organizational behavior, social welfare, and policymakers. In particular, issues surrounding work and worker flexibility, equity, and data governance and transparency pose substantial opportunities for policymaking. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014which we define broadly to include machine learning and algorithmic management\u2014is playing an increasingly large role within the corporate context. The widespread use of AI is already displacing workers through automation, augmenting human performance at work, and creating new job categories. What\u2019s more, AI is enabling, driving, and accelerating the emergence of workforce ecosystems. Workforce ecosystems are incorporating human-AI collaboration on both physical and cognitive tasks and introducing new dependencies among managers, employees, contingent workers, other service providers, and AI. Clearly, policy needs to consider how AI-based automation will affect workers and the labor market more broadly. However, focusing only on the effects of automation without considering the impact of AI on organizational and governance structures understates the extent to which AI is already influencing work, workers, and the practice of management. Policy discussions also need to consider the implications of human-AI collaborations and AI that enhances human performance (such as generative AI tools). Policymakers require a much more nuanced and comprehensive view of the dynamic relationship between workforce ecosystems and AI. To that end, this policy brief presents a framework that addresses the convergence of AI and workforce ecosystems. Within workforce ecosystems, the use of AI is changing the design of work, the supply of labor, the conduct of work, and the measurement of work and workers. Examining AI-related shifts in four categories\u2014Designing Work, Supplying Workers, Conducting Work, and Measuring Work and Workers\u2014reveals a variety of policy implications. We explore these policy considerations, highlighting themes of flexibility, equity, and data governance and transparency. Furthermore, we offer a broad view of how a shift toward workforce ecosystems and the increasing use of AI is influencing the future of work. AI and Workforce Ecosystems: A Framework Workforce ecosystems consist of workforce participants inside and outside organizations crossing all organizational levels and functions and spanning all product and service development and delivery phases. Strikingly, AI usage within workforce ecosystems is increasing and simultaneously accelerating their emergence and growth. The increasing shift toward workforce ecosystems creates new opportunities to leverage AI, and the increased use of AI further amplifies the move toward workforce ecosystems. In this brief, we present a typology to better understand the interaction between the continuing emergence of AI and the ongoing evolution of workforce ecosystems. With this framework, we aim to assist policymakers in making sense of changes accompanying AI\u2019s growth. The typology includes four categories highlighting four areas in which AI is impacting workforce ecosystems: Designing Work, Supplying Workers, Conducting Work, and Measuring Work and Workers. Each of the four categories suggests distinct (if related) policy implications. One overarching implication of this discussion is that policy for work-related AI applications is not limited to addressing automation. Despite the clear need for policy to consider implications arising from the use of AI to automate jobs and displace workers, it is insufficient to focus policy discussions only on automation and not fully consider changes in which human work is augmented by AI and in which humans and AI collaborate. Discussions omitting these factors run the risk of understating the current and future influence of AI on work, workers, and the practice of management. Policy related to AI in workforce ecosystems should balance workers\u2019 interests in sustainable and decent jobs with employers\u2019 interests in productivity and economic growth. If done properly, there is tremendous potential to leverage AI to improve working conditions, worker safety, and worker mobility/flexibility, and to work more collectively and intelligently.8 The goal of these policy refinements should be to allow businesses to meet competitive challenges while limiting the risk of dehumanizing workers, discrimination, and inequality. Policy can offer incentives to limit the use of AI in low value-added contexts, such as for automation of work with small efficiency gains, while promoting higher value-added uses of AI that increase economic productivity and employment growth.9 Designing Work The growing use of AI has a profound effect on work design in workforce ecosystems. A greater supply of AI affects how organizations design work while changes in work design drive greater demand for AI. For example, modern food delivery platforms like GrubHub and DoorDash use AI for sophisticated scheduling, matching, rating, and routing, which has essentially redesigned work within the food delivery industry. Without AI, such crowd-based work designs would not be possible. These technologies and their impact on work design reach beyond food delivery into other supply chains wherever complex delivery systems exist. Similarly, AI-driven tools enable larger, flatter, more integrated teams because entities can coordinate and collaborate more effectively. For workforce ecosystems, this means organizations can more seamlessly integrate external workers, partner organizations, and employees as they strive to meet strategic goals. On the flip side, changes in work design drive increasing demand for AI. For example, as jobs are disaggregated into tasks and work becomes more modular and/or project-based, algorithms can help humans become more effective.10 As companies refine their approach to designing work, they gain access to more data (e.g., in medical research and marketing analytics) and AI becomes even more valuable. Policy concerns associated with U.S. business\u2019s increasing reliance on contingent labor date back (at least to) the 1994 Dunlop Commission.11 Companies do not want to overcommit to hiring full-time workers with skills that will soon become obsolete and thus prefer to rely on contingent labor in many cases. They design work for maximum flexibility and productivity but not necessarily for maximum economic security for workers.12 The shift in employment away from (full- and part-time) payroll to more flexible categories (e.g., contingent workers such as long-term contractors or short-term gig workers) tends to increase the income and wealth gap between workers in full- and part-time employed positions and those in contracted roles by affecting what leverage and protection is available for various classes of workers.13 Notably, contingent work has a direct relationship with \u201cprecarious work.\u201d Precarious work has been defined as work that is \u201cuncertain, unstable, and insecure and in which employees bear the risks of work [\u2026] and receive limited social benefits and statutory protections.\u201d14 This is likely to affect workers of different skills in different ways, leading not only to income and wealth inequality but also to human capital inequality as workers with different skill levels have more or less control over their wages. For example, a highly-skilled data scientist may command a premium and may work for more than one client. In the shipping industry, most of the workers who maintain and operate commercial vessels are contractors, but they are less likely to command a premium nor will they be able to offer their services to multiple clients. Flexible, platform-based work arrangements can result in precarious work arrangements for some workers while giving flexibility, higher wages, and the ability to hyper-specialize to others. This creates human capital inequality. The difference may depend on already existing discrepancies like class, race, and gender, and thus further amplify income and wealth inequality. The growing sophistication of AI makes it easier for managers to source, vet, and hire contingent labor. This new role for AI enables managers to design work in new ways. Instead of focusing on hiring employees and filling in skill gaps with full-time labor, managers are increasingly turning to external talent markets and staffing platforms as a source of shorter-term, skills-based engagements to achieve outcomes. Managers can disaggregate existing jobs into component tasks and then use AI to access external contributors with specific skills to accomplish those tasks. Policy considerations for designing work These changes in work design affect policies for tax, labor, and technology. Federal and state governments should consider developing more inclusive and flexible policies that support all kinds of employment models so workers receive equal protection and benefits based on the value they create, not the employment status they hold. If workers are to be afforded protections that ensure sustainable, safe, and healthy work environments, the same protections should be available to all workers regardless of whether they are an employee or a contingent worker. Unemployment insurance should be modernized to expand eligibility to include workers who do not work (or seek work) full-time and to provide flexible, partial unemployment benefits. Today, firms themselves may be willing to be more flexible and creative with compensation and benefits schemes, but they sometimes only have limited opportunities to do so because of labor regulation constraints. Modernized unemployment and other labor policies would potentially increase contingent workers\u2019 access to reasonable earning opportunities, social safety nets, and benefits. Beyond unemployment insurance, other benefits including retirement savings contributions, health insurance, and medical, family, and parental leaves are similarly restricted to full-time workers for historical reasons (although the restrictions vary across geographic regions). Policies should be updated to allow portability of benefits between employers and improve access to assistance, which would dampen the income volatility faced by many contingent workers. Supplying Workers By using AI to increase the supply of workers of more types (e.g., contractors, gig workers) through improved communication, coordination, and matching, workforce ecosystems can grow more easily, effectively, and efficiently. At the same time, the growth of workforce ecosystems increases the demand for all kinds of workers, leading to more demand for AI to help increase and manage worker supply. Organizations increasingly require a variety of workers to engage in multiple ways (full-time, part-time, as professional service providers, as long- and short-term contractors, etc.). They can use AI to assist in sourcing these workers, for example, by using both internal and external labor platforms and talent marketplaces to find and match workers more effectively.15 Using AI that includes enhanced matching functions, scheduling, recruiting, planning, and evaluations increases access to a diverse corps of workers. Organizations can use AI to more effectively build workforce ecosystems that both align with specific business needs and help meet diversity goals. Increasing the use of AI can have both negative and positive consequences for supplying workers. For example, it can perpetuate or reduce bias in hiring.16 Similarly, AI systems can help ensure pay equity (by identifying and correcting gender differences in pay for similar jobs) or contribute to inequity throughout the workforce ecosystem by, for example, amplifying the value of existing skills while reducing the value of other skills.17 In workforce ecosystems where certain skills are becoming more highly valued, AI can efficiently and objectively verify and validate existing skills and find opportunities for workers to gain new skills. However, on the negative side, such public worker evaluations can lead to lasting consequences when errors are introduced into the verification process and workers have little recourse for correcting them.18 While supplying work is distinct from designing work, the boundaries between the two are porous. For example, an organization may redesign a job into modular pieces and then use an AI-powered talent marketplace to source workers to accomplish these smaller jobs. An organization could break one job into 10 discrete tasks and engage 10 people instead of one via an online labor market such as Amazon Mechanical Turk or Upwork. Further, if an organization can increasingly use AI to effectively source workers (including human and technological workers such as software bots), the organization can design work to leverage a more abundant, diverse, and flexible worker supply. Because organizations can increasingly find people (and partner organizations) to engage for shorter-term, specific assignments, they can more easily build complex and interconnected workforce ecosystems to accomplish business objectives. Policy considerations for supplying workers Policy plays multiple roles in AI-enabled workforce ecosystems related to supplying workers. We consider three sets of issues: tax policy favoring capital over labor investment; relatively inflexible existing educational policies associated with training and development; and, collective bargaining. First, policy shapes incentives for automation relative to human labor. Current U.S. tax policy has relatively high taxation of labor and relatively lower taxation of capital, which can favor automation.19 While this can benefit the remaining workers in heavily automated industries, it can provide incentives to organizations to invest in automation technologies that displace human workers. These automation investments are unlikely to be effectively constrained by taxes on robots, however.20 We need policy incentives that actually make investments in human capital and labor more attractive. These could include tax incentives for upskilling and reskilling both employees and external contributors, creating decent jobs programs, or developing programs to calibrate investments in automation and human labor.21 Second, public and private organizations can collaborate more closely on worker training and continuous learning. Organizations can build relationships across communities to provide training, reskilling, and lifelong learning for workers, especially because current regulations in some geographies, including the U.S., preclude organizations from providing training to contractual workers.22 Public-private partnerships can help enable good jobs and fair work arrangements, provide career opportunities to workers, and add economic benefits for employers. Education needs to become more flexible to provide workers with fresh skills beyond, and in some cases in place of, college. AI can be utilized not only to decompose jobs into component tasks but also to provide support for team formation and career management.23 Digital learning and digital credential and reputation systems are likely to play a key role in enabling a more flexible and comprehensive worker supply. All of these measures would support the continued growth and success of workforce ecosystems across industries and economies. Finally, policymakers should clarify the role that collective bargaining can serve in negotiating issues such as the use of technology, safety, privacy concerns, plans to expand automation, and training and access to training (e.g., paid time off to complete training) among others. Ideally, these benefits can be expanded to include all workers across an ecosystem, not just those in traditional full-time employment. Conducting Work In workforce ecosystems, humans and AI work together to create value, with varying levels of interdependency and control over one another. As stated by MIT Professor Thomas Malone:24 People have the most control when machines act only as tools; and machines have successively more control as their roles expand to assistants, peers, and, finally, managers. Policy should cover the full range of interactions that exist when humans and AI collaborate. Although these categories\u2014assistants, peers, and managers\u2014clearly overlap, each type of working relationship suggests new policy demands for conducting work. AI-as-Assistant. AI supports individual performance within workforce ecosystems. Businesses are increasingly relying on augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) technologies, for instance, to enhance individual and team performance. These technologies promise to improve worker safety in some workplace environments.25 However, new technologies also promise to allow AI-enabled workplace avatars to interact, bringing very human predilections, both prosocial and antisocial, into digital environments.26 AI-as-Peer: Humans and AI increasingly work together as collaborators in workforce ecosystems, using complementary capabilities to achieve outcomes: 60% of human workers already see AI as a co-worker.27 In hospitals, radiologists and AI work together to develop more accurate radiologic interpretations than either alone could accomplish. At law firms, algorithms are taking over elements of the arduous process of due diligence for mergers and acquisitions, analyzing thousands of documents for relevant terms, freeing associates to focus on higher-value assignments.28 AI-as-Manager: AI is already being used to direct a wide range of human behaviors in the workplace, deciding, for example, who to hire, promote, or reassign. Uber uses algorithms to assign and schedule rides, set wages, and track performance; and, AI may direct a warehouse worker\u2019s hand movement with haptic feedback based on motion sensors. AI is also being used in surveillance applications, which can be considered a form of supervision or management.29 Policy considerations for conducting work To address issues related to AI as an assistant or peer, the U.S. needs regulation for workplace safety when humans collaborate with AI agents and robots. These regulations will likely cut across existing government regulatory structures. For example, if AI assistants or robots on a factory floor need to meet cybersecurity requirements to ensure worker safety, are these standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or some other body? In OSHA\u2019s A-Z website index, there is currently no mention of cybersecurity. A key issue with AI-as-manager is that AI decisions may appear opaque and confusing, leaving workers guessing about how and why certain decisions were made and what they can do when bad data skew decisions. For example, unreasonable passengers may give low marks to rideshare drivers, which in turn adversely affects drivers\u2019 income opportunities. Policymakers could pass rules to increase transparency for workers about how algorithmic management decisions are made. Such rules could force employers and online labor platform businesses to disclose which data is used for which decisions. This would be helpful to counteract the current information asymmetry between platforms and workers. Finally, policymakers need to consider how existing anti-discrimination rules intended to regulate human decisions can be applied to algorithms and human-AI teams. Currently, algorithm-based discrimination is difficult to verify and prove given the absence of independent reviews and outside audits.3031 Such audits could help address (and possibly alleviate) unintended consequences when algorithms inadvertently exploit natural human frailties and use flawed data sets. Policymakers could mandate outside audits, establish which data can be used, support research that attempts to assess algorithmic properties, promote research on both algorithmic fairness and machine learning algorithms with provable attributes, and analyze the economic impact of human and AI collaboration. Additionally, policies seeking to reduce discrimination may need to wrestle with which bias\u2014a human\u2019s or an algorithm\u2019s\u2014is the most important bias to minimize. Measuring Work and Workers Firms are increasingly using AI to measure behaviors and performance that were once impossible to track. Advanced measurement techniques have the potential to generate efficiency gains and improve conditions for workers, but they also risk dehumanizing workers and increasing discrimination in the workplace. AI\u2019s ability to reduce the cost of data collection and analysis has greatly expanded the range of possible monitoring to include location, movement, biometrics, affect, as well as verbal and non-verbal communication. For example, AI can predict mood, personality, and emergent leadership in group meetings.32 Workers may experience such tools as intrusive even if the monitoring itself is lawful and even if workers do not directly experience the surveillance. At the same time, workers can use newly available AI systems to assess their performance in real-time and prescribe efficient actions, balance stress, and improve performance.33 Fine-grained, real-time measures may be particularly useful because they can improve processes that support collective intelligence.34 For example, AI that detects emotional shifts on phone calls may enable pharmacists to deal more effectively with customer aggravations;35 biometric sensors for workers in physical jobs can detect strenuous movements and reduce the risk of injury.36 Workers may welcome AI that augments performance and improves safety. On the other hand, a firm\u2019s desire to utilize AI for work and worker measurement poses a risk of treating workers more like machines than humans and introducing AI-based discrimination. Policy considerations for measuring work and workers Policymakers need to recognize that AI is changing the nature of surveillance beyond the regulatory scope of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA), which is the only federal law that directly governs the monitoring of electronic communications in the workplace.37 Surveillance affects not only traditional employees but also contingent workers participating in workforce ecosystems. And, in many cases, contracted workers may be subject to more, and more intrusive, monitoring than other workers, especially when working in remote locations. Three specific areas stand out as particularly relevant. Transparency: To ensure decent work, data transparency is especially crucial as tracking workers (both inside a physical location and also digitally for remote workers) can be disrespectful and violate their privacy. Currently, it is rarely clear to workers what types of data are being used to measure their performance and determine compensation and task assignment. Stories abound in which workers try to game the system by figuring out how to get the most lucrative assignments.38Policymakers need to establish legitimate purposes for data collection and use as well as guidelines for how these need to be shared with workers. They must address the risks of invasive work surveillance and discriminatory practices resulting from algorithmic management and AI systems. Guidelines for data security, privacy, ownership, sharing, and transparency should be much more specifically addressed across regulatory environments. AI Bias: Bias in algorithmic management within traditional organizations and workforce ecosystems can arise from three sources: (a) data that is used to train AI that may include human biases; (b) biased decisionmaking by software developers (who may reflect a narrow portion of the population); and (c) AI that is too rigid to detect situations in which different behavior is warranted (i.e., swerving to avoid a pothole may indicate attentive driving as opposed to inattentive). To further complicate matters, AI itself can develop software, which might introduce other biases. Equity: Employment arrangements become increasingly flexible and fluid in workforce ecosystems, and worker employment status can determine the type of monitoring. Contingent workers in a workforce ecosystem for example might be monitored in ways that employees performing similar tasks would not be. Similar inequities exist even among employees. For instance, with the growth of remote work, various types of monitoring on all employees seems to be on the rise; however, employees working from home may be subject to surveillance different from those in the office.39 Indeed, the threat of surveillance can be used to encourage a return to the workplace. Aside from the question of whether organizational culture can benefit from a threat-induced return to work, there is a substantive question about whether businesses should be allowed to selectively protect or exploit privacy among employees performing similar jobs. To address possible discriminatory practices, policymakers need to establish rules for legitimate data collection and use and for equitable protections of privacy in different work arrangements. At the same time, those policies need to be carefully balanced against the need for work and worker flexibility, innovation, and economic growth. Conclusion Corporate uses of AI are transforming the design and conduct of work, the supply of labor, and the measurement of work and workers. At the same time, companies are increasingly dependent on a wide range of actors, employees and beyond, to accomplish work. The intersection of these two trends has more consequential and broad policy implications than automation in the workplace. Today, many of the protections and benefits workers receive still depend on their classification as an employee versus a contingent worker. We need policies that can: anticipate and account for a variety of work arrangements to ensure safety and equity for workers across categories; accommodate increasingly novel work arrangements that support and protect all workers; balance workers\u2019 desires for decent jobs with organizations\u2019 needs for sustainability and economic growth. All of this needs to be accomplished while policymakers keep a careful eye on unintended consequences. Both AI technologies and firm practices are developing rapidly, making it difficult to predict which future work arrangements may be most successful in which circumstances. Hence, decisionmakers should strive to develop policies that increase rather than constrain innovation for future work arrangements that benefit both workers and organizations. Policymakers should explicitly allow experimentation and learning while limiting regulatory complexity associated with AI in workforce ecosystems.",

TRANSCRIPT [music] STOCK: I\u2019m Jim Stock, coeditor of the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, the semiannual academic conference and journal that pairs rigorous research with real time policy analysis to address the most urgent economic challenges of the day. On behalf of my coeditor Jan Eberly of Northwestern University, as well as the rest of the Brookings team, I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us for this episode of the Brookings Podcast on Economic Activity. Here we share conversations with leading economists on the research they do and how it will affect economic policy. On this episode, you\u2019ll hear from Deborah Lucas of MIT and Gee Hee Hong of the International Monetary Fund and their new paper, \u201cCOVID credit policies around the world: Size, scope, costs and consequences.\u201d They\u2019ll be interviewed by Wendy Edelberg of the Hamilton Project. Governments have long used credit policies to complement standard fiscal policies. Credit policies include things like subsidizing or guaranteeing loans and loan forbearance. The United States in particular, made significant use of credit policies during the COVID pandemic, for example, through the Paycheck Protection Program. Looking forward as fiscal capacity gets stretched in many countries, it\u2019s plausible that governments will increasingly look towards credit policies as tools for achieving broader policy goals. The expansion of credit policies raises many questions, starting with how large they are and how effective they are. This is a vast research program, and Lucas and Hong take an important first step by examining credit policies during the COVID pandemic. They have quite a few interesting findings, and I hope you enjoy this episode. I\u2019ll now hand it over to Wendy, Deborah and Gee Hee. EDELBERG: Thank you, Jim. I am Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project at Brookings. And joining me today is Gee Hee Hong, an economist at the Fiscal Affairs Department at the International Monetary Fund, and Debbie Lucas, the Sloan Distinguished Professor of Finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management and director of the MIT Golub Center for Finance and Policy. We\u2019ll be discussing their new paper, which they presented at the Spring 2023 Brookings Paper on Economic Activity Conference in Washington, D.C. So first, let me say thank you, Gee Hee and Debbie, for joining me today. So, Gee Hee, let\u2019s start with you. You guys both analyzed the size and effect of many types of credit policies used by countries during the height of the pandemic. Can you describe for our listeners some of those policies? HONG: Sure. First of all, Wendy, thank you very much for having us. So, if we go back to what happened in 2020, in the face of an unprecedented public health crisis, governments imposed lockdown measures to limit economic activity which actually jeopardized people\u2019s livelihoods and the survival of businesses. So, to support households and firms, governments introduced a flurry of measures. And in this paper, we are focusing on credit policies such as credit guarantee programs, governments direct lending to households and firms, as well as large scale loan forbearance and payment moratoria programs, which actually allowed borrowers to stop making payments on mortgages, rents, and student loans, for instance. And this was a crucial pillar of government support during COVID. Countries made available more than $6 trillion at the global level. But despite this sheer size, we noticed that credit policies are often underappreciated in the literature and more importantly, in the narrative when we talk about the economic impact of macro policies introduced during COVID. So, this is, in our view, one important contribution of our paper to recognize the important role credit policies played during the pandemic and perhaps in the years that follow. EDELBERG: Yeah. I think your paper is going to be an amazing resource in that regard. Debbie, let\u2019s bring you in. So, your paper talks about the challenges of sizing these policies. Can you walk us through why that\u2019s more complicated than that just looking at the dollars appropriated by policymakers or looking at total amounts of loans or something like that? LUCAS: Thanks, Wendy, for asking about that. In fact, an important message of our paper is that official government statistics all too often entirely fail to measure or mismeasure the size and cost of these credit policies. In fact, the lack of reliable and readily available official statistics we think is an important reason, maybe the most important reason, that economists typically haven\u2019t tried to quantify the effects of credit policies on a macroeconomic scale. To quote an old saw, what isn\u2019t measured isn\u2019t seen. So, an important part of what we do in this paper and in some of our other recent work is to produce statistics on the size and cost of the credit programs that are suitable for macroeconomic analysis. I also want to emphasize that there\u2019s not a one size fits all statistic for these programs. Certainly one aspect is the size of their budgetary cost or equivalently the associated government subsidies that are conveyed to borrowers. A second aspect and the one we focus on most in this paper is related to how much funding that households and firms obtain through these programs. So, just to contrast the two, in most instances the cost or the subsidy is much smaller than the funding obtained because much of the borrowing is going to be eventually repaid. But you asked specifically about why appropriations aren\u2019t an adequate measure. I guess the simplest answer is that the authorized size of these programs in the U.S. and elsewhere significantly exceeds the amounts of funds they provided. That\u2019s what we call \u201ctake up.\u201d You also astutely mentioned the total amount of loans made is irrelevant. In fact, that\u2019s what we\u2019re striving to measure for loan guarantees and direct lending programs. The idea is that those amounts are at least as a first approximation similar in their stimulus effects to that of traditional fiscal policy. But unfortunately, those statistics are just not commonly reported, at least not centrally reported. We found data on take up from a variety of sources, including reports by the agencies administering the programs. We found the situation to be even more complicated for the large scale forbearance programs. Many of those arose outside of the normal appropriation process, and there\u2019s typically extremely little information that\u2019s made publicly available. So, measuring the amount of additional funds obtained with forbearance is more complicated and also requires some assumptions and some financial math to take into account that it\u2019s the missed payments not the take up that\u2019s the relevant concept for measuring the potential stimulus arising from those programs. EDELBERG: So, the title of your paper includes \u201csize, scope, costs, and consequences,\u201d that you set a difficult task for yourself. Tell me about the findings that you want the listeners to know? LUCAS: Well, we found that these credit policies, when they\u2019re properly measured, significantly increase the resources in the pockets of firms and households. It brought the average share of funds obtained from 14 and a half percent of GDP when you only look at fiscal policies, to 22% when all of these credit and forbearance policies are added on top of traditional fiscal measures. What was maybe the most striking to us and something we certainly weren\u2019t expecting is the very different picture one gets of the relative aggressiveness of government policies across these countries. So, whereas there\u2019s considerable variation in the use of traditional fiscal policies\u2014and notably the U.S. looks particularly aggressive by that measure\u2014if you look at the cross-country variation, it\u2019s much lower when credit and forbearance policies are also taken into account. Now, in terms of the macroeconomic effects of these policies, we also find some interesting results. Although I must say that the sample size is just seven countries and this one episode, so we can\u2019t draw any formal inferences. But with that disclaimer, a finding that was quite suggestive of the importance of credit support and forbearance policies is that there\u2019s a much stronger positive correlation between the cross section of real GDP growth in late 2020 through late 2021 when you look at the broad measure that includes credit programs then if you just look at fiscal spending alone. We also find that the very elevated savings rates during 2020 and 2021 are highly correlated with the combined funds provided by credit and fiscal policies. We also wanted to explore the connection between credit policy and inflation. We don\u2019t find that including credit policies helps to directly explain the cross section of inflation across these countries. But we\u2019d conjecture that the much higher and more uniform levels of incremental resources provided by European and U.S. governments and the likelihood that a significant fraction of all of these resources were initially saved rather than spent is at least consistent with pandemic fiscal and credit policies having significantly contributed to the sharp increase in subsequent inflation in all of these countries. EDELBERG: Debbie, one more question for you. So, you talked about the importance of take up in in your measurements. So, one factor I know that was important in the U.S. just from other work that I\u2019ve done was that some sectors of the economy bounced back very quickly and the size of fiscal support going to households meant tremendous support for spending. So, how do you think about the relationship between credit policies in 2020 and in 2021 and other fiscal policies? I guess what I\u2019m trying to get at is if businesses saw enormous demand for their products because of the fiscal support going to households that helped to support spending, how do you think about the interplay between those kinds of fiscal support for households and take up for these loans by businesses and the like? LUCAS: Yeah, that\u2019s a great question. I just want to actually first note that in responding to the pandemic, the U.S. actually relied much less heavily on credit support than did all of the other countries we studied. In fact, the U.S. primarily depended on the fiscal policies that you just mentioned. However, what the U.S. did was for the first time they introduced these large scale forbearance programs, particularly for government backed mortgages and for student loans. And, you know, those forbearance policies we estimated represented a pretty modest fraction of GDP, about six-tenths of 1%. Those programs also helped people that were struggling to meet those fixed expenses, much as expanded unemployment insurance or the checks sent to households did. So, I would say that those forbearance policies complemented some of the fiscal stimulus that was provided. Interesting in the U.S. context is that it was possible to authorize those policies without any congressional action because they affected existing government loan programs where there was already administrative authority to provide forbearance. So, that\u2019s something special to the U.S., which lets them get money out the door quite quickly by introducing forbearance policies. EDELBERG: Gee Hee, I have a question for you about take up and whether or not take up may underestimate how important credit programs are. So, some have argued that even for credit programs that had little take up\u2014and here, just for context, what I\u2019m thinking about is like some of the Fed programs, credit programs in the U.S. that had very little take up\u2014some have argued that even though those programs may have had very little take up, their existence was hugely important for confidence, just for example. So, does that sound right? And then how should we how should we then think about that channel of credit programs mattering in the context of all of your findings? HONG: That\u2019s a great question, Wendy. To be clear, I think there is an element in any policy announcements that will affect sentiment. And as you mentioned, the Fed credit program, or the central bank liquidity facilities, of government providing a backstop when uncertainty is high, they will certainly boost confidence in the market. But for credit policies, we think that households and firms may be more interested in perhaps in actually using these policies because they will directly alleviate their debt burdens or relax their credit constraints, for instance. So, in that context, the aspect that interested us more was the design of policy. For instance, how terms of guarantees and forbearance were designed and how they made programs attractive so that economic agents would actually use them. EDELBERG: So, let me throw this question wide open to both of you and thinking that our listeners are probably maybe even more focused on the financial system right now than at other times, what are your findings telling you about policy going forward? Like, should credit policies be used alongside conventional monetary policy and fiscal policy? Like, how important is this in policymakers\u2019 toolkits? HONG: So, in our paper, our findings suggest that these credit policies can be a very powerful tool to support households and businesses, potentially at a much lower cost than other traditional fiscal measures. But these needs to be very carefully designed and well targeted. And in our view, going forward credit policies are likely to play a more prominent role because if you think about countries facing limited fiscal space with high levels of debt and spending to rise further to tackle various, for instance, short-term and long-term challenges like climate agenda, credit policies are going to be a very attractive option for governments to continue to support the economy without overburdening the budget. So, this means that the credit policy will continue to play a more important role, but also at the same time, there should be a caution that they should pay more attention and recognize that the budget cost of the fiscal risks related to the programs. LUCAS: Thanks, Gee Hee. I\u2019d agree with a lot of what you said, but my bottom line is that credit policy should be used only with extreme caution. You mentioned that credit support programs can be effective, but I would say that\u2019s really only clearly true during episodes where there\u2019s a breakdown in the functioning of private credit markets or also as a way to help target beneficiaries like students and small businesses with limited access on their own to credit markets and that wouldn\u2019t be able to obtain credit without government support. But I think that all too often these policies are used in preference to more transparent forms of assistance. Not only do they hide the upfront costs of providing credit, but they leave governments exposed to considerable future financial risk. That risk is, for instance, that guarantees will be called upon when the economy is very weak, when fiscal resources are already very strained. And so, I also think that now that these credit policies have become more normalized by their aggressive rollout during the pandemic, it\u2019s likely they, in fact, will be adopted more readily in future crises. So, to prepare for that, I think governments need to revamp their disclosures about credit policies and make their costs and risks much more transparent. And I\u2019m hoping that the economics profession will help them in getting there. EDELBERG: So, Debbie and Gee Hee, you both talked about the use of credit programs, both during times of crisis, but also during times when markets are just not complete and households or businesses don\u2019t have access to credit, which may be occurring, obviously, outside of times of crisis. So, Debbie, you\u2019ve alluded to this, but can I draw you out a little bit more to draw the distinction between when credit programs should be used simply in a time of crisis or when credit programs might be appropriate, just as a more structural part of fiscal policy. LUCAS: Yeah. Thanks, Wendy. So, I personally believe that these programs should only be used to correct market imperfections. And the reason for that is because of their lack of transparency. And, the fact that they\u2019re mostly outside of the budget process makes them very undisciplined. But when they have economic justification is when they\u2019re addressing some kind of an externality or serious problem in the markets. So, there\u2019s episodic problems, like during the global financial crisis where credit markets just stopped functioning. And there was also that concern that it might happen during COVID. So, during a large crisis, there\u2019s a reason for governments to step in and support credit markets to make sure that they continue to function. But other than a severe crisis, as you mentioned, the reason to have credit programs is to correct kind of standing market imperfections that arise because of what you might refer to as incomplete information. So, young borrowers with no credit history, students, or small businesses have limited access to credit. I guess another example is people who want to buy houses who don\u2019t have a lot of credit history might be unable to do so in the completely unregulated private market. So, there is a rationale for governments to come in and support credit for those purposes in a kind of on a kind of standing basis. EDELBERG: This has been a super conversation. And let me just reiterate something I said earlier, which is your paper is going to be just a tremendous resource going forward as we think about not just what role credit programs played during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also how we should be using these programs going forward and be thinking about them and measuring them and thinking about their effectiveness. So, I just want to thank you both for putting in this incredibly hard work to write this paper.

The central bank said Wednesday that recent economic data is reinforcing its confidence that inflation will continue to fall in the coming months. \u201cHowever, getting inflation the rest of the way back down to two per cent could prove to be more difficult,\u201d the Bank of Canada said in a news release. The central bank said its governing council will continue to assess whether interest rates are high enough to bring inflation back to target. Economists were widely anticipating the Bank of Canada to maintain its interest rate as inflation eases meaningfully. Canada\u2019s annual inflation rate fell to 5.2 per cent in February, marking the second month in a row it came in lower than forecast. Related: Bank of Canada holds key rate for first time in a year, leaves door open to hikes The Bank of Canada continues to expect the inflation rate to fall to three per cent by mid-year and back down to two per cent by the end of 2024. Its decision to stay on the sidelines and not raise interest rates further comes as the economy posts stronger-than-expected growth and the labour market remains exceptionally tight \u2013 both signs of a still-hot economy. The Bank of Canada said \u201cdemand is still exceeding supply and the labour market remains tight.\u201d In its quarterly monetary policy report released Wednesday, the central bank\u2019s updated forecasts suggest it expects the economy to still slow, just a little later than previously anticipated. It\u2019s now expecting real gross domestic product to grow by 1.4 per cent this year, up from its previous forecast of 1.0 per cent. Employment in Canada has remained resilient amid high interest rates, with the unemployment rate sitting at five per cent in February, near record lows. Wages are also growing rapidly, raising concern for the Bank of Canada as it works to bring down price growth. For 2024, the Bank of Canada revised growth to 1.3 per cent, down from 1.8 per cent. As foreign demand for Canadian exports strengthens and the effects of past monetary policy tightening fade, the economy is expected to rebound in 2025 and grow by 2.5 per cent. Globally, the Bank of Canada said growth has been stronger than anticipated, also leading to an upward revision to growth this year and a downward revision for next year. Looking ahead, the path back to low inflation and stronger growth in Canada relies on high interest rates working effectively. Since March of last year, the Bank of Canada has aggressively raised its key interest rate to stifle spending in the economy. But after historic monetary policy tightening, the Bank of Canada has hit the brakes. It announced earlier this year it plans to hold its key interest rate steady to allow time for the effects of higher borrowing costs to broaden out in the economy. Given the run-up in prices largely occurred in the first half of 2022, the slowdown in inflation this year was largely expected. However, economists and the central bank are concerned getting exactly back to the two per cent target might be more challenging, with some components of inflation still sticky. The central bank\u2019s concern stems from several factors, including consumers and businesses expecting future inflation to be higher than the Bank of Canada\u2019s forecasts. It\u2019s also concerned about prices for services still rising rapidly \u2013 in part due to rapid wage growth \u2013 and businesses still able to easily pass on higher prices to consumers. The central bank its governing council will be watching these indicators along with core inflation closely, as it sets monetary policy moving forward.",

                  "content": "Traveling with kids can be a great adventure but it may also be filled with many potential pitfalls. Here are some mistakes parents make when exploring the globe with their children and what to do instead.1. Trying To Save Money With A Cheaper Flight Adobe Flights are often the most expensive part of travel with kids. But dont sacrifice your sanity for a small amount of savings. Cheaper itineraries often involve early or late flights plus stops along the way. The more layovers and middle-of-the-night departures you add to your travels, the harder your trip with kids will be.Experts also often discourage treating your almost 2-year-old toddler as a lap child. You save money if you dont buy an extra seat, but you also have an active child on your lap and possibly a very uncomfortable flight. Plus, buying basic economy seats where you dont get to pick your seat assignment may mean youll be separated from your kids. If youve read any social media comment threads about parents asking others to switch seats for their kids, youll know its not guaranteed that another passenger will agree to switch seats with you.2. Not Taking The Right Luggage Adobe The best kids suitcase is easy to tote, can carry what you need, and will last for many trips. Its not the adorable but teeny-tiny carry-on that wont fit much at all.Insiders Alesandra Dubin, recommends skipping gimmicky child suitcases and getting a good quality 20-inch suitcase in a fun color instead. Starting at age 5, her kids also began pulling/carrying their own suitcases/backpacks.DWYM has recommendations for the best kids suitcase.3. Not Bringing Car Seats Onto The Plane Adobe Lugging car seats around an airport and onto a flight seems like a hassle, but I know from personal experience that they are worth the trouble. My kids slept better in them when they were small.The Car Seat Lady points out that children are used to traveling in car seats and often feel more secure in them, even on a plane. When left to flop around freely in an airplane seat, my kiddos tended to be squirmy and restless.Taking your airline-approved car seat on the plane also prevents any damage to it while in cargo or as its being carried to and from the gate for stowage. When you reach your destination, you dont have to figure out how to rent one to drive your kids around.Last but not least, your child is safest on an airplane when buckled into a properly strapped-in car seat.4. Forgetting Carry-On Essentials Adobe Some parents board a plane trusting that in-flight entertainment and onboard food purchases will get them and their kids through a flight. But it seems like airlines continue to cut back on their onboard offerings every year, especially since the pandemic.The Points Guy points out that kids may get hangry if you dont have the right food on hand for them. And sometimes flights arent equipped with seatback screens or apps you can download to your devices. Make sure you pack extra food and entertainment.Dubin recommends bringing extra clothes for you and your kids when they are young, especially if they are prone to motion sickness. She also likes to bring a trash bag to collect the flotsam your children create on a flight (this works for a road trip too).Add in more wipes than youd think you need, hand sanitizer, and the all-important set of headphones to listen to entertainment! And dont forget an extra charger.5. Having The Whole Family Share One Room Adobe You may think a little inconvenience is worth the extra savings youll get if you share one room with your kids. But that savings means that when your kids go down for the night, youre huddled in the bathroom or outside in the hall trying to read or watch TV without waking them.\u00a0 After all, you cant leave your kids alone and go elsewhere.Budget for more space, whether thats a suite-type room, adjoining hotel rooms, or a vacation rental where you can really spread out. A middle-ground option for sharing a room in a warm weather location is to make sure it has a balcony you and your partner can relax on after the kids are in bed.6. Not Planning For Your Kids Pace Adobe Kids need downtime and naps on a trip to avoid meltdowns. They also need time to recover from a change in time zones.The Traveling Canucks say they always plan for their first day at their destination to be an easy day of lounging at the pool, watching movies, or just hanging in the room in order to acclimate.Kendra Thornton of Royal Travel & Tours told The New York Times that travel with kids often works best if you plan a half day of activities and the other half for more open play and relaxation at a park or pool or back at your hotel room.7. Not Making A Plan For If Your Child Gets Lost Adobe Children slip away before you know it in big crowds or unfamiliar areas. Make sure youve talked with your kids about what to do if they ever get lost.Do they know your phone number? My friend Jenn once told me the best hack for getting her children to memorize her phone number. She made the iPad log-in code her cell digits and her kids had it memorized in no time.Police officers, security guards and park employees are good people to tell your kids to look to for help when they are lost. But when those cant be found, some suggest training your kids to seek out a mom or dad (spotted with strollers and kids in tow).Todays Parent and Very Well Family have other tips on helping your kids know what to do if they get lost.8. Eating Out For Every Meal Adobe You can waste a lot of trip time and money dining out for every meal on vacation. Plan to eat at least one meal a day as a grab-and-go deal or back at your lodgings.If youve got picky eaters you know theyll be just as happy with cereal and microwaved mac and cheese made in your hotel room as they would be at a restaurant where the menu options are unfamiliar. And youll save money in the process.Tips for Family Trips has several suggestions on food while traveling, such as looking into a vacation rental with a kitchen or kitchenette where you can make meals yourself. You cut down on costs and your kids can have their end-of-day meltdowns in the privacy of your own space.Traveling with children is an art, not a science, and your own kids personalities as well as your family dynamic will guide how you operate on trips to other places. But these tips can make your life a bit easier and when youre away from home, thats a good thing.This story originally appeared on Don't Waste Your Money.

                  "content": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) price maintained the $30,000 support as lower-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released on April 12. The official inflation rate for March increased 5% year on year, which was slightly less than the 5.1% consensus. It was the lowest reading since May 2021, but is still significantly higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The data suggests that inflation is no longer the driving force behind Bitcoin\u2019s rally and Investors' focus shifted from the impact of inflationary pressure to potential recession risks after the banking crisis revealed how fragile the financial system was following the Federal Reserve's twelve-month hike in interest rates from 0.10% to 4.85%. Aside from the Silicon Valley Bank bankruptcy and the government-backed sale of Credit Suisse to UBS, several warning signs of a macroeconomic downturn have emerged. The most recent ISM Purchasing Managers Index data fell to its lowest level since May 2020, indicating an economic contraction. According to Federal Reserve documents released on April 12, the aftermath of the U.S. banking crisis is likely to push the economy into a \"mild recession\" later this year. Because of the crisis, some have speculated that the Fed will hold off on raising interest rates, but officials affirmed that more effort is needed to keep inflation under control. According to a Moody's Analytics report, commercial real estate prices fell 1.6% in February, the most since the 2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, the national office vacancy rate reached 16.5%, indicating the severity of the economic difficulties that businesses are currently facing. Whatever the reason for Bitcoin's 50% rally between March 11 and April 11, it demonstrates resilience to FUD, including the SEC's Wells Notice against Coinbase on March 22, and the CFTC filing a suit against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao on March 27. By holding the $30,000 support, Bitcoin demonstrates that the positive momentum can continue regardless of whether inflation remains above 5%. Not everyone is cheering the rally, particularly traders who have placed bearish bets using Bitcoin options. The April 14 open interest for BTC options expiry is $950 million, with $490 million in call (buy) options and $460 million in put (sell) options. Bears have been caught off guard, with less than 7% of their bets exceeding $29,000. Below are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of call (buy) and put (sell) options contracts available on April 14 varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit: This rough estimate considers only call options in bullish bets and put options in neutral-to-bearish trades. Nonetheless, this oversimplification excludes more complex investment strategies. A trader, for example, could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a certain price, but this effect is difficult to estimate. Related: Bitcoin-friendly PPI data boosts bulls as Ether price fights for $2K Bulls are expected to push Bitcoin above $30,500 on April 14 at 8:00 a.m UTC to profit an additional $100 million. Bears, on the other hand, would need to pressure Bitcoin's price below $29,000 in order to balance the scales. However, bears have recently suffered significant losses as BTC futures short contracts were forcibly liquidated to the tune of $128 million between April 9 and April 11. As the most likely scenario favors Bitcoin bulls, their profits will most likely be used to reinforce the $30,000 support. Bears might consider licking their wounds and waiting for additional actions from regulators as the macroeconomic scenario is currently bullish for supply capped assets.

The Hutchins Roundup keeps you informed of the latest research, charts, and speeches. Want to receive the Hutchins Roundup as an email? Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday. Men, but not women, leave school when short-term earnings opportunities arise J\u00f3sef Sigurdsson of Stockholm University finds that a change to the Icelandic tax code led men to drop out of school without similarly affecting women. Iceland collected no income tax on earnings in 1987 as it changed its national taxation system, creating an opportunity for Icelanders to earn substantially more in the short term. Dropout rates for men who were just old enough to leave high school and start working were 5 percentage points higher than for men just below the cutoff, while dropout rates for women were unchanged. Dropouts rarely returned to school and suffered large losses in lifetime income despite higher earnings in the years after 1987. The findings indicate that short-term earnings opportunities affect men and women differently, suggesting \u201cgender differences in nonpecuniary costs of school attendance, myopia, or perceived returns to education.\u201d The tradeoff between inflation and labor market slack is higher in tight labor markets Using U.S. industry-level data over the 1959 to 2022 period, Simon C. Smith of the Federal Reserve Board, Allan Timmermann of the University of California, San Diego, and Jonathan H. Wright of Johns Hopkins University find that the Phillips Curve \u2013 the relationship between inflation and labor market slack \u2013 steepened in 1972 (meaning that inflation became more sensitive to slack) and flattened in 2001. The flattening was more pronounced for goods prices than service prices and concentrated in metropolitan areas with higher rates of import penetration from China. The authors also find that the Phillips Curve is nonlinear and steeper when the labor market is tight. A steeper Phillips Curve and a higher natural rate of unemployment can explain about half of the surge in prices over the 2020-2022 period, they find. Breaks in the slope of the Phillips Curve make pre-break data less informative for policymakers, causing them to be less certain about the relationship between the unemployment gap and inflation. To compensate for this additional caution, policymakers \u201crespond less aggressively to deviations in the unemployment gap but, conversely, respond more aggressively to deviations from target inflation,\u201d the authors say. China\u2019s growing role in cross-border rescue lending China\u2019s role as an international lender of last resort has grown exponentially in recent years, according to Sebastian Horn of the World Bank and co-authors. Since 2000, more than 20 debtor countries \u2014 primarily debtors of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative \u2014 have received $240 billion USD from the People\u2019s Bank of China in rescue lending \u2014 $170 billion USD via a global swap line that is quickly growing, and $70 billion USD in rescue loans for balance of payments support. Of this, $185 billion USD was lent between 2016 and 2021. China\u2019s overseas lending, the authors say, is making the international financial system more multipolar, less institutionalized, and less transparent. Chart of the week: Core services inflation remains high Chart courtesy of Jason Furman Quote of the week: \u201cWith financial instability contained, monetary policy should remain focused on bringing inflation down, but stand ready to quickly adjust to financial developments. A silver lining is that the banking turmoil will help slow aggregate activity as banks curtail lending. In and of itself, this should partially mitigate the need for further monetary tightening to achieve the same policy stance. But any expectation that central banks will prematurely surrender the inflation fight would have the opposite effect: lowering yields, supporting activity beyond what is warranted, and ultimately complicating the task of monetary authorities. Fiscal policy can also play an active role. By cooling off economic activity, tighter fiscal policy would support monetary policy, allowing real interest rates to return faster to a low natural level. Appropriately designed fiscal consolidation will also help rebuild much needed buffers and help strengthen financial stability. While fiscal policy is turning less expansionary in many countries this year, more could be done to regain fiscal space,\u201d says Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Economic Counsellor of the International Monetary Fund. \u201cOur latest projections also indicate an overall slowdown in medium-term growth forecasts. Five-year ahead growth projections declined steadily from 4.6% in 2011 to 3% in 2023. Some of this decline reflects the growth slowdown of previously rapidly growing economies such as China or Korea. This is predictable: growth slows down as countries converge. But some of the more recent slowdown may also reflect more ominous forces: the scarring impact of the pandemic, a slower pace of structural reforms, as well as the rising and increasingly real threat of geoeconomic fragmentation leading to more trade tensions, less direct investment, and a slower pace of innovation and technology adoption across fragmented \u2018blocks.\u2019 A fragmented world is unlikely to achieve progress for all, or to successfully tackle global challenges such as climate change or pandemic preparedness. We must avoid that path at all costs.\u201d The Brookings Institution is financed through the support of a diverse array of foundations, corporations, governments, individuals, as well as an endowment.

                  "content": "By David Kiron, Elizabeth J. Altman, Christoph RiedlCompanies increasingly rely on an extended workforce (e.g., contractors, gig workers, professional service firms, complementor organizations, and technologies such as algorithmic management and artificial intelligence) to achieve strategic goals and objectives.1 When we ask leaders to describe how they define their workforce today, they mention a diverse array of participants, beyond just full- and part-time employees, all contributing in various ways. Many of these leaders observe that their extended workforce now comprises 30-50% of their entire workforce. For example, Novartis has approximately 100,000 employees and counts more than 50,000 other workers as external contributors.2 Businesses are also increasingly using crowdsourcing platforms to engage external participants in the development of products and services.34 Managers are thinking about their workforce in terms of who contributes to outcomes, not just by workers\u2019 employment arrangements.5 Our ongoing research on workforce ecosystems demonstrates that managing work across organizational boundaries with groups of interdependent actors in a variety of employment relationships creates new opportunities and risks for both workers and businesses.6 These are not subtle shifts. We define a workforce ecosystem as:7 A structure that encompasses actors, from within the organization and beyond, working to create value for an organization. Within the ecosystem, actors work toward individual and collective goals with interdependencies and complementarities among the participants. The emergence of workforce ecosystems has implications for management theory, organizational behavior, social welfare, and policymakers. In particular, issues surrounding work and worker flexibility, equity, and data governance and transparency pose substantial opportunities for policymaking. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014which we define broadly to include machine learning and algorithmic management\u2014is playing an increasingly large role within the corporate context. The widespread use of AI is already displacing workers through automation, augmenting human performance at work, and creating new job categories. What\u2019s more, AI is enabling, driving, and accelerating the emergence of workforce ecosystems. Workforce ecosystems are incorporating human-AI collaboration on both physical and cognitive tasks and introducing new dependencies among managers, employees, contingent workers, other service providers, and AI. Clearly, policy needs to consider how AI-based automation will affect workers and the labor market more broadly. However, focusing only on the effects of automation without considering the impact of AI on organizational and governance structures understates the extent to which AI is already influencing work, workers, and the practice of management. Policy discussions also need to consider the implications of human-AI collaborations and AI that enhances human performance (such as generative AI tools). Policymakers require a much more nuanced and comprehensive view of the dynamic relationship between workforce ecosystems and AI. To that end, this policy brief presents a framework that addresses the convergence of AI and workforce ecosystems. Within workforce ecosystems, the use of AI is changing the design of work, the supply of labor, the conduct of work, and the measurement of work and workers. Examining AI-related shifts in four categories\u2014Designing Work, Supplying Workers, Conducting Work, and Measuring Work and Workers\u2014reveals a variety of policy implications. We explore these policy considerations, highlighting themes of flexibility, equity, and data governance and transparency. Furthermore, we offer a broad view of how a shift toward workforce ecosystems and the increasing use of AI is influencing the future of work. AI and Workforce Ecosystems: A Framework Workforce ecosystems consist of workforce participants inside and outside organizations crossing all organizational levels and functions and spanning all product and service development and delivery phases. Strikingly, AI usage within workforce ecosystems is increasing and simultaneously accelerating their emergence and growth. The increasing shift toward workforce ecosystems creates new opportunities to leverage AI, and the increased use of AI further amplifies the move toward workforce ecosystems. In this brief, we present a typology to better understand the interaction between the continuing emergence of AI and the ongoing evolution of workforce ecosystems. With this framework, we aim to assist policymakers in making sense of changes accompanying AI\u2019s growth. The typology includes four categories highlighting four areas in which AI is impacting workforce ecosystems: Designing Work, Supplying Workers, Conducting Work, and Measuring Work and Workers. Each of the four categories suggests distinct (if related) policy implications. One overarching implication of this discussion is that policy for work-related AI applications is not limited to addressing automation. Despite the clear need for policy to consider implications arising from the use of AI to automate jobs and displace workers, it is insufficient to focus policy discussions only on automation and not fully consider changes in which human work is augmented by AI and in which humans and AI collaborate. Discussions omitting these factors run the risk of understating the current and future influence of AI on work, workers, and the practice of management. Policy related to AI in workforce ecosystems should balance workers\u2019 interests in sustainable and decent jobs with employers\u2019 interests in productivity and economic growth. If done properly, there is tremendous potential to leverage AI to improve working conditions, worker safety, and worker mobility/flexibility, and to work more collectively and intelligently.8 The goal of these policy refinements should be to allow businesses to meet competitive challenges while limiting the risk of dehumanizing workers, discrimination, and inequality. Policy can offer incentives to limit the use of AI in low value-added contexts, such as for automation of work with small efficiency gains, while promoting higher value-added uses of AI that increase economic productivity and employment growth.9 Designing Work The growing use of AI has a profound effect on work design in workforce ecosystems. A greater supply of AI affects how organizations design work while changes in work design drive greater demand for AI. For example, modern food delivery platforms like GrubHub and DoorDash use AI for sophisticated scheduling, matching, rating, and routing, which has essentially redesigned work within the food delivery industry. Without AI, such crowd-based work designs would not be possible. These technologies and their impact on work design reach beyond food delivery into other supply chains wherever complex delivery systems exist. Similarly, AI-driven tools enable larger, flatter, more integrated teams because entities can coordinate and collaborate more effectively. For workforce ecosystems, this means organizations can more seamlessly integrate external workers, partner organizations, and employees as they strive to meet strategic goals. On the flip side, changes in work design drive increasing demand for AI. For example, as jobs are disaggregated into tasks and work becomes more modular and/or project-based, algorithms can help humans become more effective.10 As companies refine their approach to designing work, they gain access to more data (e.g., in medical research and marketing analytics) and AI becomes even more valuable. Policy concerns associated with U.S. business\u2019s increasing reliance on contingent labor date back (at least to) the 1994 Dunlop Commission.11 Companies do not want to overcommit to hiring full-time workers with skills that will soon become obsolete and thus prefer to rely on contingent labor in many cases. They design work for maximum flexibility and productivity but not necessarily for maximum economic security for workers.12 The shift in employment away from (full- and part-time) payroll to more flexible categories (e.g., contingent workers such as long-term contractors or short-term gig workers) tends to increase the income and wealth gap between workers in full- and part-time employed positions and those in contracted roles by affecting what leverage and protection is available for various classes of workers.13 Notably, contingent work has a direct relationship with \u201cprecarious work.\u201d Precarious work has been defined as work that is \u201cuncertain, unstable, and insecure and in which employees bear the risks of work [\u2026] and receive limited social benefits and statutory protections.\u201d14 This is likely to affect workers of different skills in different ways, leading not only to income and wealth inequality but also to human capital inequality as workers with different skill levels have more or less control over their wages. For example, a highly-skilled data scientist may command a premium and may work for more than one client. In the shipping industry, most of the workers who maintain and operate commercial vessels are contractors, but they are less likely to command a premium nor will they be able to offer their services to multiple clients. Flexible, platform-based work arrangements can result in precarious work arrangements for some workers while giving flexibility, higher wages, and the ability to hyper-specialize to others. This creates human capital inequality. The difference may depend on already existing discrepancies like class, race, and gender, and thus further amplify income and wealth inequality. The growing sophistication of AI makes it easier for managers to source, vet, and hire contingent labor. This new role for AI enables managers to design work in new ways. Instead of focusing on hiring employees and filling in skill gaps with full-time labor, managers are increasingly turning to external talent markets and staffing platforms as a source of shorter-term, skills-based engagements to achieve outcomes. Managers can disaggregate existing jobs into component tasks and then use AI to access external contributors with specific skills to accomplish those tasks. Policy considerations for designing work These changes in work design affect policies for tax, labor, and technology. Federal and state governments should consider developing more inclusive and flexible policies that support all kinds of employment models so workers receive equal protection and benefits based on the value they create, not the employment status they hold. If workers are to be afforded protections that ensure sustainable, safe, and healthy work environments, the same protections should be available to all workers regardless of whether they are an employee or a contingent worker. Unemployment insurance should be modernized to expand eligibility to include workers who do not work (or seek work) full-time and to provide flexible, partial unemployment benefits. Today, firms themselves may be willing to be more flexible and creative with compensation and benefits schemes, but they sometimes only have limited opportunities to do so because of labor regulation constraints. Modernized unemployment and other labor policies would potentially increase contingent workers\u2019 access to reasonable earning opportunities, social safety nets, and benefits. Beyond unemployment insurance, other benefits including retirement savings contributions, health insurance, and medical, family, and parental leaves are similarly restricted to full-time workers for historical reasons (although the restrictions vary across geographic regions). Policies should be updated to allow portability of benefits between employers and improve access to assistance, which would dampen the income volatility faced by many contingent workers. Supplying Workers By using AI to increase the supply of workers of more types (e.g., contractors, gig workers) through improved communication, coordination, and matching, workforce ecosystems can grow more easily, effectively, and efficiently. At the same time, the growth of workforce ecosystems increases the demand for all kinds of workers, leading to more demand for AI to help increase and manage worker supply. Organizations increasingly require a variety of workers to engage in multiple ways (full-time, part-time, as professional service providers, as long- and short-term contractors, etc.). They can use AI to assist in sourcing these workers, for example, by using both internal and external labor platforms and talent marketplaces to find and match workers more effectively.15 Using AI that includes enhanced matching functions, scheduling, recruiting, planning, and evaluations increases access to a diverse corps of workers. Organizations can use AI to more effectively build workforce ecosystems that both align with specific business needs and help meet diversity goals. Increasing the use of AI can have both negative and positive consequences for supplying workers. For example, it can perpetuate or reduce bias in hiring.16 Similarly, AI systems can help ensure pay equity (by identifying and correcting gender differences in pay for similar jobs) or contribute to inequity throughout the workforce ecosystem by, for example, amplifying the value of existing skills while reducing the value of other skills.17 In workforce ecosystems where certain skills are becoming more highly valued, AI can efficiently and objectively verify and validate existing skills and find opportunities for workers to gain new skills. However, on the negative side, such public worker evaluations can lead to lasting consequences when errors are introduced into the verification process and workers have little recourse for correcting them.18 While supplying work is distinct from designing work, the boundaries between the two are porous. For example, an organization may redesign a job into modular pieces and then use an AI-powered talent marketplace to source workers to accomplish these smaller jobs. An organization could break one job into 10 discrete tasks and engage 10 people instead of one via an online labor market such as Amazon Mechanical Turk or Upwork. Further, if an organization can increasingly use AI to effectively source workers (including human and technological workers such as software bots), the organization can design work to leverage a more abundant, diverse, and flexible worker supply. Because organizations can increasingly find people (and partner organizations) to engage for shorter-term, specific assignments, they can more easily build complex and interconnected workforce ecosystems to accomplish business objectives. Policy considerations for supplying workers Policy plays multiple roles in AI-enabled workforce ecosystems related to supplying workers. We consider three sets of issues: tax policy favoring capital over labor investment; relatively inflexible existing educational policies associated with training and development; and, collective bargaining. First, policy shapes incentives for automation relative to human labor. Current U.S. tax policy has relatively high taxation of labor and relatively lower taxation of capital, which can favor automation.19 While this can benefit the remaining workers in heavily automated industries, it can provide incentives to organizations to invest in automation technologies that displace human workers. These automation investments are unlikely to be effectively constrained by taxes on robots, however.20 We need policy incentives that actually make investments in human capital and labor more attractive. These could include tax incentives for upskilling and reskilling both employees and external contributors, creating decent jobs programs, or developing programs to calibrate investments in automation and human labor.21 Second, public and private organizations can collaborate more closely on worker training and continuous learning. Organizations can build relationships across communities to provide training, reskilling, and lifelong learning for workers, especially because current regulations in some geographies, including the U.S., preclude organizations from providing training to contractual workers.22 Public-private partnerships can help enable good jobs and fair work arrangements, provide career opportunities to workers, and add economic benefits for employers. Education needs to become more flexible to provide workers with fresh skills beyond, and in some cases in place of, college. AI can be utilized not only to decompose jobs into component tasks but also to provide support for team formation and career management.23 Digital learning and digital credential and reputation systems are likely to play a key role in enabling a more flexible and comprehensive worker supply. All of these measures would support the continued growth and success of workforce ecosystems across industries and economies. Finally, policymakers should clarify the role that collective bargaining can serve in negotiating issues such as the use of technology, safety, privacy concerns, plans to expand automation, and training and access to training (e.g., paid time off to complete training) among others. Ideally, these benefits can be expanded to include all workers across an ecosystem, not just those in traditional full-time employment. Conducting Work In workforce ecosystems, humans and AI work together to create value, with varying levels of interdependency and control over one another. As stated by MIT Professor Thomas Malone:24 People have the most control when machines act only as tools; and machines have successively more control as their roles expand to assistants, peers, and, finally, managers. Policy should cover the full range of interactions that exist when humans and AI collaborate. Although these categories\u2014assistants, peers, and managers\u2014clearly overlap, each type of working relationship suggests new policy demands for conducting work. AI-as-Assistant. AI supports individual performance within workforce ecosystems. Businesses are increasingly relying on augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) technologies, for instance, to enhance individual and team performance. These technologies promise to improve worker safety in some workplace environments.25 However, new technologies also promise to allow AI-enabled workplace avatars to interact, bringing very human predilections, both prosocial and antisocial, into digital environments.26 AI-as-Peer: Humans and AI increasingly work together as collaborators in workforce ecosystems, using complementary capabilities to achieve outcomes: 60% of human workers already see AI as a co-worker.27 In hospitals, radiologists and AI work together to develop more accurate radiologic interpretations than either alone could accomplish. At law firms, algorithms are taking over elements of the arduous process of due diligence for mergers and acquisitions, analyzing thousands of documents for relevant terms, freeing associates to focus on higher-value assignments.28 AI-as-Manager: AI is already being used to direct a wide range of human behaviors in the workplace, deciding, for example, who to hire, promote, or reassign. Uber uses algorithms to assign and schedule rides, set wages, and track performance; and, AI may direct a warehouse worker\u2019s hand movement with haptic feedback based on motion sensors. AI is also being used in surveillance applications, which can be considered a form of supervision or management.29 Policy considerations for conducting work To address issues related to AI as an assistant or peer, the U.S. needs regulation for workplace safety when humans collaborate with AI agents and robots. These regulations will likely cut across existing government regulatory structures. For example, if AI assistants or robots on a factory floor need to meet cybersecurity requirements to ensure worker safety, are these standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or some other body? In OSHA\u2019s A-Z website index, there is currently no mention of cybersecurity. A key issue with AI-as-manager is that AI decisions may appear opaque and confusing, leaving workers guessing about how and why certain decisions were made and what they can do when bad data skew decisions. For example, unreasonable passengers may give low marks to rideshare drivers, which in turn adversely affects drivers\u2019 income opportunities. Policymakers could pass rules to increase transparency for workers about how algorithmic management decisions are made. Such rules could force employers and online labor platform businesses to disclose which data is used for which decisions. This would be helpful to counteract the current information asymmetry between platforms and workers. Finally, policymakers need to consider how existing anti-discrimination rules intended to regulate human decisions can be applied to algorithms and human-AI teams. Currently, algorithm-based discrimination is difficult to verify and prove given the absence of independent reviews and outside audits.3031 Such audits could help address (and possibly alleviate) unintended consequences when algorithms inadvertently exploit natural human frailties and use flawed data sets. Policymakers could mandate outside audits, establish which data can be used, support research that attempts to assess algorithmic properties, promote research on both algorithmic fairness and machine learning algorithms with provable attributes, and analyze the economic impact of human and AI collaboration. Additionally, policies seeking to reduce discrimination may need to wrestle with which bias\u2014a human\u2019s or an algorithm\u2019s\u2014is the most important bias to minimize. Measuring Work and Workers Firms are increasingly using AI to measure behaviors and performance that were once impossible to track. Advanced measurement techniques have the potential to generate efficiency gains and improve conditions for workers, but they also risk dehumanizing workers and increasing discrimination in the workplace. AI\u2019s ability to reduce the cost of data collection and analysis has greatly expanded the range of possible monitoring to include location, movement, biometrics, affect, as well as verbal and non-verbal communication. For example, AI can predict mood, personality, and emergent leadership in group meetings.32 Workers may experience such tools as intrusive even if the monitoring itself is lawful and even if workers do not directly experience the surveillance. At the same time, workers can use newly available AI systems to assess their performance in real-time and prescribe efficient actions, balance stress, and improve performance.33 Fine-grained, real-time measures may be particularly useful because they can improve processes that support collective intelligence.34 For example, AI that detects emotional shifts on phone calls may enable pharmacists to deal more effectively with customer aggravations;35 biometric sensors for workers in physical jobs can detect strenuous movements and reduce the risk of injury.36 Workers may welcome AI that augments performance and improves safety. On the other hand, a firm\u2019s desire to utilize AI for work and worker measurement poses a risk of treating workers more like machines than humans and introducing AI-based discrimination. Policy considerations for measuring work and workers Policymakers need to recognize that AI is changing the nature of surveillance beyond the regulatory scope of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA), which is the only federal law that directly governs the monitoring of electronic communications in the workplace.37 Surveillance affects not only traditional employees but also contingent workers participating in workforce ecosystems. And, in many cases, contracted workers may be subject to more, and more intrusive, monitoring than other workers, especially when working in remote locations. Three specific areas stand out as particularly relevant. Transparency: To ensure decent work, data transparency is especially crucial as tracking workers (both inside a physical location and also digitally for remote workers) can be disrespectful and violate their privacy. Currently, it is rarely clear to workers what types of data are being used to measure their performance and determine compensation and task assignment. Stories abound in which workers try to game the system by figuring out how to get the most lucrative assignments.38Policymakers need to establish legitimate purposes for data collection and use as well as guidelines for how these need to be shared with workers. They must address the risks of invasive work surveillance and discriminatory practices resulting from algorithmic management and AI systems. Guidelines for data security, privacy, ownership, sharing, and transparency should be much more specifically addressed across regulatory environments. AI Bias: Bias in algorithmic management within traditional organizations and workforce ecosystems can arise from three sources: (a) data that is used to train AI that may include human biases; (b) biased decisionmaking by software developers (who may reflect a narrow portion of the population); and (c) AI that is too rigid to detect situations in which different behavior is warranted (i.e., swerving to avoid a pothole may indicate attentive driving as opposed to inattentive). To further complicate matters, AI itself can develop software, which might introduce other biases. Equity: Employment arrangements become increasingly flexible and fluid in workforce ecosystems, and worker employment status can determine the type of monitoring. Contingent workers in a workforce ecosystem for example might be monitored in ways that employees performing similar tasks would not be. Similar inequities exist even among employees. For instance, with the growth of remote work, various types of monitoring on all employees seems to be on the rise; however, employees working from home may be subject to surveillance different from those in the office.39 Indeed, the threat of surveillance can be used to encourage a return to the workplace. Aside from the question of whether organizational culture can benefit from a threat-induced return to work, there is a substantive question about whether businesses should be allowed to selectively protect or exploit privacy among employees performing similar jobs. To address possible discriminatory practices, policymakers need to establish rules for legitimate data collection and use and for equitable protections of privacy in different work arrangements. At the same time, those policies need to be carefully balanced against the need for work and worker flexibility, innovation, and economic growth. Conclusion Corporate uses of AI are transforming the design and conduct of work, the supply of labor, and the measurement of work and workers. At the same time, companies are increasingly dependent on a wide range of actors, employees and beyond, to accomplish work. The intersection of these two trends has more consequential and broad policy implications than automation in the workplace. Today, many of the protections and benefits workers receive still depend on their classification as an employee versus a contingent worker. We need policies that can: anticipate and account for a variety of work arrangements to ensure safety and equity for workers across categories; accommodate increasingly novel work arrangements that support and protect all workers; balance workers\u2019 desires for decent jobs with organizations\u2019 needs for sustainability and economic growth. All of this needs to be accomplished while policymakers keep a careful eye on unintended consequences. Both AI technologies and firm practices are developing rapidly, making it difficult to predict which future work arrangements may be most successful in which circumstances. Hence, decisionmakers should strive to develop policies that increase rather than constrain innovation for future work arrangements that benefit both workers and organizations. Policymakers should explicitly allow experimentation and learning while limiting regulatory complexity associated with AI in workforce ecosystems.",

TRANSCRIPT [music] STOCK: I\u2019m Jim Stock, coeditor of the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, the semiannual academic conference and journal that pairs rigorous research with real time policy analysis to address the most urgent economic challenges of the day. On behalf of my coeditor Jan Eberly of Northwestern University, as well as the rest of the Brookings team, I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us for this episode of the Brookings Podcast on Economic Activity. Here we share conversations with leading economists on the research they do and how it will affect economic policy. On this episode, you\u2019ll hear from Deborah Lucas of MIT and Gee Hee Hong of the International Monetary Fund and their new paper, \u201cCOVID credit policies around the world: Size, scope, costs and consequences.\u201d They\u2019ll be interviewed by Wendy Edelberg of the Hamilton Project. Governments have long used credit policies to complement standard fiscal policies. Credit policies include things like subsidizing or guaranteeing loans and loan forbearance. The United States in particular, made significant use of credit policies during the COVID pandemic, for example, through the Paycheck Protection Program. Looking forward as fiscal capacity gets stretched in many countries, it\u2019s plausible that governments will increasingly look towards credit policies as tools for achieving broader policy goals. The expansion of credit policies raises many questions, starting with how large they are and how effective they are. This is a vast research program, and Lucas and Hong take an important first step by examining credit policies during the COVID pandemic. They have quite a few interesting findings, and I hope you enjoy this episode. I\u2019ll now hand it over to Wendy, Deborah and Gee Hee. EDELBERG: Thank you, Jim. I am Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project at Brookings. And joining me today is Gee Hee Hong, an economist at the Fiscal Affairs Department at the International Monetary Fund, and Debbie Lucas, the Sloan Distinguished Professor of Finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management and director of the MIT Golub Center for Finance and Policy. We\u2019ll be discussing their new paper, which they presented at the Spring 2023 Brookings Paper on Economic Activity Conference in Washington, D.C. So first, let me say thank you, Gee Hee and Debbie, for joining me today. So, Gee Hee, let\u2019s start with you. You guys both analyzed the size and effect of many types of credit policies used by countries during the height of the pandemic. Can you describe for our listeners some of those policies? HONG: Sure. First of all, Wendy, thank you very much for having us. So, if we go back to what happened in 2020, in the face of an unprecedented public health crisis, governments imposed lockdown measures to limit economic activity which actually jeopardized people\u2019s livelihoods and the survival of businesses. So, to support households and firms, governments introduced a flurry of measures. And in this paper, we are focusing on credit policies such as credit guarantee programs, governments direct lending to households and firms, as well as large scale loan forbearance and payment moratoria programs, which actually allowed borrowers to stop making payments on mortgages, rents, and student loans, for instance. And this was a crucial pillar of government support during COVID. Countries made available more than $6 trillion at the global level. But despite this sheer size, we noticed that credit policies are often underappreciated in the literature and more importantly, in the narrative when we talk about the economic impact of macro policies introduced during COVID. So, this is, in our view, one important contribution of our paper to recognize the important role credit policies played during the pandemic and perhaps in the years that follow. EDELBERG: Yeah. I think your paper is going to be an amazing resource in that regard. Debbie, let\u2019s bring you in. So, your paper talks about the challenges of sizing these policies. Can you walk us through why that\u2019s more complicated than that just looking at the dollars appropriated by policymakers or looking at total amounts of loans or something like that? LUCAS: Thanks, Wendy, for asking about that. In fact, an important message of our paper is that official government statistics all too often entirely fail to measure or mismeasure the size and cost of these credit policies. In fact, the lack of reliable and readily available official statistics we think is an important reason, maybe the most important reason, that economists typically haven\u2019t tried to quantify the effects of credit policies on a macroeconomic scale. To quote an old saw, what isn\u2019t measured isn\u2019t seen. So, an important part of what we do in this paper and in some of our other recent work is to produce statistics on the size and cost of the credit programs that are suitable for macroeconomic analysis. I also want to emphasize that there\u2019s not a one size fits all statistic for these programs. Certainly one aspect is the size of their budgetary cost or equivalently the associated government subsidies that are conveyed to borrowers. A second aspect and the one we focus on most in this paper is related to how much funding that households and firms obtain through these programs. So, just to contrast the two, in most instances the cost or the subsidy is much smaller than the funding obtained because much of the borrowing is going to be eventually repaid. But you asked specifically about why appropriations aren\u2019t an adequate measure. I guess the simplest answer is that the authorized size of these programs in the U.S. and elsewhere significantly exceeds the amounts of funds they provided. That\u2019s what we call \u201ctake up.\u201d You also astutely mentioned the total amount of loans made is irrelevant. In fact, that\u2019s what we\u2019re striving to measure for loan guarantees and direct lending programs. The idea is that those amounts are at least as a first approximation similar in their stimulus effects to that of traditional fiscal policy. But unfortunately, those statistics are just not commonly reported, at least not centrally reported. We found data on take up from a variety of sources, including reports by the agencies administering the programs. We found the situation to be even more complicated for the large scale forbearance programs. Many of those arose outside of the normal appropriation process, and there\u2019s typically extremely little information that\u2019s made publicly available. So, measuring the amount of additional funds obtained with forbearance is more complicated and also requires some assumptions and some financial math to take into account that it\u2019s the missed payments not the take up that\u2019s the relevant concept for measuring the potential stimulus arising from those programs. EDELBERG: So, the title of your paper includes \u201csize, scope, costs, and consequences,\u201d that you set a difficult task for yourself. Tell me about the findings that you want the listeners to know? LUCAS: Well, we found that these credit policies, when they\u2019re properly measured, significantly increase the resources in the pockets of firms and households. It brought the average share of funds obtained from 14 and a half percent of GDP when you only look at fiscal policies, to 22% when all of these credit and forbearance policies are added on top of traditional fiscal measures. What was maybe the most striking to us and something we certainly weren\u2019t expecting is the very different picture one gets of the relative aggressiveness of government policies across these countries. So, whereas there\u2019s considerable variation in the use of traditional fiscal policies\u2014and notably the U.S. looks particularly aggressive by that measure\u2014if you look at the cross-country variation, it\u2019s much lower when credit and forbearance policies are also taken into account. Now, in terms of the macroeconomic effects of these policies, we also find some interesting results. Although I must say that the sample size is just seven countries and this one episode, so we can\u2019t draw any formal inferences. But with that disclaimer, a finding that was quite suggestive of the importance of credit support and forbearance policies is that there\u2019s a much stronger positive correlation between the cross section of real GDP growth in late 2020 through late 2021 when you look at the broad measure that includes credit programs then if you just look at fiscal spending alone. We also find that the very elevated savings rates during 2020 and 2021 are highly correlated with the combined funds provided by credit and fiscal policies. We also wanted to explore the connection between credit policy and inflation. We don\u2019t find that including credit policies helps to directly explain the cross section of inflation across these countries. But we\u2019d conjecture that the much higher and more uniform levels of incremental resources provided by European and U.S. governments and the likelihood that a significant fraction of all of these resources were initially saved rather than spent is at least consistent with pandemic fiscal and credit policies having significantly contributed to the sharp increase in subsequent inflation in all of these countries. EDELBERG: Debbie, one more question for you. So, you talked about the importance of take up in in your measurements. So, one factor I know that was important in the U.S. just from other work that I\u2019ve done was that some sectors of the economy bounced back very quickly and the size of fiscal support going to households meant tremendous support for spending. So, how do you think about the relationship between credit policies in 2020 and in 2021 and other fiscal policies? I guess what I\u2019m trying to get at is if businesses saw enormous demand for their products because of the fiscal support going to households that helped to support spending, how do you think about the interplay between those kinds of fiscal support for households and take up for these loans by businesses and the like? LUCAS: Yeah, that\u2019s a great question. I just want to actually first note that in responding to the pandemic, the U.S. actually relied much less heavily on credit support than did all of the other countries we studied. In fact, the U.S. primarily depended on the fiscal policies that you just mentioned. However, what the U.S. did was for the first time they introduced these large scale forbearance programs, particularly for government backed mortgages and for student loans. And, you know, those forbearance policies we estimated represented a pretty modest fraction of GDP, about six-tenths of 1%. Those programs also helped people that were struggling to meet those fixed expenses, much as expanded unemployment insurance or the checks sent to households did. So, I would say that those forbearance policies complemented some of the fiscal stimulus that was provided. Interesting in the U.S. context is that it was possible to authorize those policies without any congressional action because they affected existing government loan programs where there was already administrative authority to provide forbearance. So, that\u2019s something special to the U.S., which lets them get money out the door quite quickly by introducing forbearance policies. EDELBERG: Gee Hee, I have a question for you about take up and whether or not take up may underestimate how important credit programs are. So, some have argued that even for credit programs that had little take up\u2014and here, just for context, what I\u2019m thinking about is like some of the Fed programs, credit programs in the U.S. that had very little take up\u2014some have argued that even though those programs may have had very little take up, their existence was hugely important for confidence, just for example. So, does that sound right? And then how should we how should we then think about that channel of credit programs mattering in the context of all of your findings? HONG: That\u2019s a great question, Wendy. To be clear, I think there is an element in any policy announcements that will affect sentiment. And as you mentioned, the Fed credit program, or the central bank liquidity facilities, of government providing a backstop when uncertainty is high, they will certainly boost confidence in the market. But for credit policies, we think that households and firms may be more interested in perhaps in actually using these policies because they will directly alleviate their debt burdens or relax their credit constraints, for instance. So, in that context, the aspect that interested us more was the design of policy. For instance, how terms of guarantees and forbearance were designed and how they made programs attractive so that economic agents would actually use them. EDELBERG: So, let me throw this question wide open to both of you and thinking that our listeners are probably maybe even more focused on the financial system right now than at other times, what are your findings telling you about policy going forward? Like, should credit policies be used alongside conventional monetary policy and fiscal policy? Like, how important is this in policymakers\u2019 toolkits? HONG: So, in our paper, our findings suggest that these credit policies can be a very powerful tool to support households and businesses, potentially at a much lower cost than other traditional fiscal measures. But these needs to be very carefully designed and well targeted. And in our view, going forward credit policies are likely to play a more prominent role because if you think about countries facing limited fiscal space with high levels of debt and spending to rise further to tackle various, for instance, short-term and long-term challenges like climate agenda, credit policies are going to be a very attractive option for governments to continue to support the economy without overburdening the budget. So, this means that the credit policy will continue to play a more important role, but also at the same time, there should be a caution that they should pay more attention and recognize that the budget cost of the fiscal risks related to the programs. LUCAS: Thanks, Gee Hee. I\u2019d agree with a lot of what you said, but my bottom line is that credit policy should be used only with extreme caution. You mentioned that credit support programs can be effective, but I would say that\u2019s really only clearly true during episodes where there\u2019s a breakdown in the functioning of private credit markets or also as a way to help target beneficiaries like students and small businesses with limited access on their own to credit markets and that wouldn\u2019t be able to obtain credit without government support. But I think that all too often these policies are used in preference to more transparent forms of assistance. Not only do they hide the upfront costs of providing credit, but they leave governments exposed to considerable future financial risk. That risk is, for instance, that guarantees will be called upon when the economy is very weak, when fiscal resources are already very strained. And so, I also think that now that these credit policies have become more normalized by their aggressive rollout during the pandemic, it\u2019s likely they, in fact, will be adopted more readily in future crises. So, to prepare for that, I think governments need to revamp their disclosures about credit policies and make their costs and risks much more transparent. And I\u2019m hoping that the economics profession will help them in getting there. EDELBERG: So, Debbie and Gee Hee, you both talked about the use of credit programs, both during times of crisis, but also during times when markets are just not complete and households or businesses don\u2019t have access to credit, which may be occurring, obviously, outside of times of crisis. So, Debbie, you\u2019ve alluded to this, but can I draw you out a little bit more to draw the distinction between when credit programs should be used simply in a time of crisis or when credit programs might be appropriate, just as a more structural part of fiscal policy. LUCAS: Yeah. Thanks, Wendy. So, I personally believe that these programs should only be used to correct market imperfections. And the reason for that is because of their lack of transparency. And, the fact that they\u2019re mostly outside of the budget process makes them very undisciplined. But when they have economic justification is when they\u2019re addressing some kind of an externality or serious problem in the markets. So, there\u2019s episodic problems, like during the global financial crisis where credit markets just stopped functioning. And there was also that concern that it might happen during COVID. So, during a large crisis, there\u2019s a reason for governments to step in and support credit markets to make sure that they continue to function. But other than a severe crisis, as you mentioned, the reason to have credit programs is to correct kind of standing market imperfections that arise because of what you might refer to as incomplete information. So, young borrowers with no credit history, students, or small businesses have limited access to credit. I guess another example is people who want to buy houses who don\u2019t have a lot of credit history might be unable to do so in the completely unregulated private market. So, there is a rationale for governments to come in and support credit for those purposes in a kind of on a kind of standing basis. EDELBERG: This has been a super conversation. And let me just reiterate something I said earlier, which is your paper is going to be just a tremendous resource going forward as we think about not just what role credit programs played during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also how we should be using these programs going forward and be thinking about them and measuring them and thinking about their effectiveness. So, I just want to thank you both for putting in this incredibly hard work to write this paper. [music] LUCAS: Thank you so much, Wendy, for the opportunity to talk about this with you and to get the message out. HONG: Thank you, Wendy.

                  "content": "The Bank of Canada is once again holding its key interest rate steady at 4.5 per cent but isn\u2019t ruling out the possibility of more rate hikes down the line. The central bank said Wednesday that recent economic data is reinforcing its confidence that inflation will continue to fall in the coming months. \u201cHowever, getting inflation the rest of the way back down to two per cent could prove to be more difficult,\u201d the Bank of Canada said in a news release. The central bank said its governing council will continue to assess whether interest rates are high enough to bring inflation back to target. Economists were widely anticipating the Bank of Canada to maintain its interest rate as inflation eases meaningfully. Canada\u2019s annual inflation rate fell to 5.2 per cent in February, marking the second month in a row it came in lower than forecast. Related: Bank of Canada holds key rate for first time in a year, leaves door open to hikes The Bank of Canada continues to expect the inflation rate to fall to three per cent by mid-year and back down to two per cent by the end of 2024. Its decision to stay on the sidelines and not raise interest rates further comes as the economy posts stronger-than-expected growth and the labour market remains exceptionally tight \u2013 both signs of a still-hot economy. The Bank of Canada said \u201cdemand is still exceeding supply and the labour market remains tight.\u201d In its quarterly monetary policy report released Wednesday, the central bank\u2019s updated forecasts suggest it expects the economy to still slow, just a little later than previously anticipated. It\u2019s now expecting real gross domestic product to grow by 1.4 per cent this year, up from its previous forecast of 1.0 per cent. Employment in Canada has remained resilient amid high interest rates, with the unemployment rate sitting at five per cent in February, near record lows. Wages are also growing rapidly, raising concern for the Bank of Canada as it works to bring down price growth. For 2024, the Bank of Canada revised growth to 1.3 per cent, down from 1.8 per cent. As foreign demand for Canadian exports strengthens and the effects of past monetary policy tightening fade, the economy is expected to rebound in 2025 and grow by 2.5 per cent. Globally, the Bank of Canada said growth has been stronger than anticipated, also leading to an upward revision to growth this year and a downward revision for next year. Looking ahead, the path back to low inflation and stronger growth in Canada relies on high interest rates working effectively. Since March of last year, the Bank of Canada has aggressively raised its key interest rate to stifle spending in the economy. But after historic monetary policy tightening, the Bank of Canada has hit the brakes. It announced earlier this year it plans to hold its key interest rate steady to allow time for the effects of higher borrowing costs to broaden out in the economy. Given the run-up in prices largely occurred in the first half of 2022, the slowdown in inflation this year was largely expected. However, economists and the central bank are concerned getting exactly back to the two per cent target might be more challenging, with some components of inflation still sticky. The central bank\u2019s concern stems from several factors, including consumers and businesses expecting future inflation to be higher than the Bank of Canada\u2019s forecasts. It\u2019s also concerned about prices for services still rising rapidly \u2013 in part due to rapid wage growth \u2013 and businesses still able to easily pass on higher prices to consumers. The central bank its governing council will be watching these indicators along with core inflation closely, as it sets monetary policy moving forward.",

                  "content": "Traveling with kids can be a great adventure but it may also be filled with many potential pitfalls. Here are some mistakes parents make when exploring the globe with their children and what to do instead.1. Trying To Save Money With A Cheaper Flight Adobe Flights are often the most expensive part of travel with kids. But dont sacrifice your sanity for a small amount of savings. Cheaper itineraries often involve early or late flights plus stops along the way. The more layovers and middle-of-the-night departures you add to your travels, the harder your trip with kids will be.Experts also often discourage treating your almost 2-year-old toddler as a lap child. You save money if you dont buy an extra seat, but you also have an active child on your lap and possibly a very uncomfortable flight. Plus, buying basic economy seats where you dont get to pick your seat assignment may mean youll be separated from your kids. If youve read any social media comment threads about parents asking others to switch seats for their kids, youll know its not guaranteed that another passenger will agree to switch seats with you.2. Not Taking The Right Luggage Adobe The best kids suitcase is easy to tote, can carry what you need, and will last for many trips. Its not the adorable but teeny-tiny carry-on that wont fit much at all.Insiders Alesandra Dubin, recommends skipping gimmicky child suitcases and getting a good quality 20-inch suitcase in a fun color instead. Starting at age 5, her kids also began pulling/carrying their own suitcases/backpacks.DWYM has recommendations for the best kids suitcase.3. Not Bringing Car Seats Onto The Plane Adobe Lugging car seats around an airport and onto a flight seems like a hassle, but I know from personal experience that they are worth the trouble. My kids slept better in them when they were small.The Car Seat Lady points out that children are used to traveling in car seats and often feel more secure in them, even on a plane. When left to flop around freely in an airplane seat, my kiddos tended to be squirmy and restless.Taking your airline-approved car seat on the plane also prevents any damage to it while in cargo or as its being carried to and from the gate for stowage. When you reach your destination, you dont have to figure out how to rent one to drive your kids around.Last but not least, your child is safest on an airplane when buckled into a properly strapped-in car seat.4. Forgetting Carry-On Essentials Adobe Some parents board a plane trusting that in-flight entertainment and onboard food purchases will get them and their kids through a flight. But it seems like airlines continue to cut back on their onboard offerings every year, especially since the pandemic.The Points Guy points out that kids may get hangry if you dont have the right food on hand for them. And sometimes flights arent equipped with seatback screens or apps you can download to your devices. Make sure you pack extra food and entertainment.Dubin recommends bringing extra clothes for you and your kids when they are young, especially if they are prone to motion sickness. She also likes to bring a trash bag to collect the flotsam your children create on a flight (this works for a road trip too).Add in more wipes than youd think you need, hand sanitizer, and the all-important set of headphones to listen to entertainment! And dont forget an extra charger.5. Having The Whole Family Share One Room Adobe You may think a little inconvenience is worth the extra savings youll get if you share one room with your kids. But that savings means that when your kids go down for the night, youre huddled in the bathroom or outside in the hall trying to read or watch TV without waking them.\u00a0 After all, you cant leave your kids alone and go elsewhere.Budget for more space, whether thats a suite-type room, adjoining hotel rooms, or a vacation rental where you can really spread out. A middle-ground option for sharing a room in a warm weather location is to make sure it has a balcony you and your partner can relax on after the kids are in bed.6. Not Planning For Your Kids Pace Adobe Kids need downtime and naps on a trip to avoid meltdowns. They also need time to recover from a change in time zones.The Traveling Canucks say they always plan for their first day at their destination to be an easy day of lounging at the pool, watching movies, or just hanging in the room in order to acclimate.Kendra Thornton of Royal Travel & Tours told The New York Times that travel with kids often works best if you plan a half day of activities and the other half for more open play and relaxation at a park or pool or back at your hotel room.7. Not Making A Plan For If Your Child Gets Lost Adobe Children slip away before you know it in big crowds or unfamiliar areas. Make sure youve talked with your kids about what to do if they ever get lost.Do they know your phone number? My friend Jenn once told me the best hack for getting her children to memorize her phone number. She made the iPad log-in code her cell digits and her kids had it memorized in no time.Police officers, security guards and park employees are good people to tell your kids to look to for help when they are lost. But when those cant be found, some suggest training your kids to seek out a mom or dad (spotted with strollers and kids in tow).Todays Parent and Very Well Family have other tips on helping your kids know what to do if they get lost.8. Eating Out For Every Meal Adobe You can waste a lot of trip time and money dining out for every meal on vacation. Plan to eat at least one meal a day as a grab-and-go deal or back at your lodgings.If youve got picky eaters you know theyll be just as happy with cereal and microwaved mac and cheese made in your hotel room as they would be at a restaurant where the menu options are unfamiliar. And youll save money in the process.Tips for Family Trips has several suggestions on food while traveling, such as looking into a vacation rental with a kitchen or kitchenette where you can make meals yourself. You cut down on costs and your kids can have their end-of-day meltdowns in the privacy of your own space.Traveling with children is an art, not a science, and your own kids personalities as well as your family dynamic will guide how you operate on trips to other places. But these tips can make your life a bit easier and when youre away from home, thats a good thing.This story originally appeared on Don't Waste Your Money.

                  "content": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) price maintained the $30,000 support as lower-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released on April 12. The official inflation rate for March increased 5% year on year, which was slightly less than the 5.1% consensus. It was the lowest reading since May 2021, but is still significantly higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The data suggests that inflation is no longer the driving force behind Bitcoin\u2019s rally and Investors' focus shifted from the impact of inflationary pressure to potential recession risks after the banking crisis revealed how fragile the financial system was following the Federal Reserve's twelve-month hike in interest rates from 0.10% to 4.85%. Aside from the Silicon Valley Bank bankruptcy and the government-backed sale of Credit Suisse to UBS, several warning signs of a macroeconomic downturn have emerged. The most recent ISM Purchasing Managers Index data fell to its lowest level since May 2020, indicating an economic contraction. According to Federal Reserve documents released on April 12, the aftermath of the U.S. banking crisis is likely to push the economy into a \"mild recession\" later this year. Because of the crisis, some have speculated that the Fed will hold off on raising interest rates, but officials affirmed that more effort is needed to keep inflation under control. According to a Moody's Analytics report, commercial real estate prices fell 1.6% in February, the most since the 2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, the national office vacancy rate reached 16.5%, indicating the severity of the economic difficulties that businesses are currently facing. Whatever the reason for Bitcoin's 50% rally between March 11 and April 11, it demonstrates resilience to FUD, including the SEC's Wells Notice against Coinbase on March 22, and the CFTC filing a suit against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao on March 27. By holding the $30,000 support, Bitcoin demonstrates that the positive momentum can continue regardless of whether inflation remains above 5%. Not everyone is cheering the rally, particularly traders who have placed bearish bets using Bitcoin options. The April 14 open interest for BTC options expiry is $950 million, with $490 million in call (buy) options and $460 million in put (sell) options. Bears have been caught off guard, with less than 7% of their bets exceeding $29,000. Below are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of call (buy) and put (sell) options contracts available on April 14 varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit: This rough estimate considers only call options in bullish bets and put options in neutral-to-bearish trades. Nonetheless, this oversimplification excludes more complex investment strategies. A trader, for example, could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a certain price, but this effect is difficult to estimate. Related: Bitcoin-friendly PPI data boosts bulls as Ether price fights for $2K Bulls are expected to push Bitcoin above $30,500 on April 14 at 8:00 a.m UTC to profit an additional $100 million. Bears, on the other hand, would need to pressure Bitcoin's price below $29,000 in order to balance the scales. However, bears have recently suffered significant losses as BTC futures short contracts were forcibly liquidated to the tune of $128 million between April 9 and April 11. As the most likely scenario favors Bitcoin bulls, their profits will most likely be used to reinforce the $30,000 support. Bears might consider licking their wounds and waiting for additional actions from regulators as the macroeconomic scenario is currently bullish for supply capped assets.

The Hutchins Roundup keeps you informed of the latest research, charts, and speeches. Want to receive the Hutchins Roundup as an email? Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday. Men, but not women, leave school when short-term earnings opportunities arise J\u00f3sef Sigurdsson of Stockholm University finds that a change to the Icelandic tax code led men to drop out of school without similarly affecting women. Iceland collected no income tax on earnings in 1987 as it changed its national taxation system, creating an opportunity for Icelanders to earn substantially more in the short term. Dropout rates for men who were just old enough to leave high school and start working were 5 percentage points higher than for men just below the cutoff, while dropout rates for women were unchanged. Dropouts rarely returned to school and suffered large losses in lifetime income despite higher earnings in the years after 1987. The findings indicate that short-term earnings opportunities affect men and women differently, suggesting \u201cgender differences in nonpecuniary costs of school attendance, myopia, or perceived returns to education.\u201d The tradeoff between inflation and labor market slack is higher in tight labor markets Using U.S. industry-level data over the 1959 to 2022 period, Simon C. Smith of the Federal Reserve Board, Allan Timmermann of the University of California, San Diego, and Jonathan H. Wright of Johns Hopkins University find that the Phillips Curve \u2013 the relationship between inflation and labor market slack \u2013 steepened in 1972 (meaning that inflation became more sensitive to slack) and flattened in 2001. The flattening was more pronounced for goods prices than service prices and concentrated in metropolitan areas with higher rates of import penetration from China. The authors also find that the Phillips Curve is nonlinear and steeper when the labor market is tight. A steeper Phillips Curve and a higher natural rate of unemployment can explain about half of the surge in prices over the 2020-2022 period, they find. Breaks in the slope of the Phillips Curve make pre-break data less informative for policymakers, causing them to be less certain about the relationship between the unemployment gap and inflation. To compensate for this additional caution, policymakers \u201crespond less aggressively to deviations in the unemployment gap but, conversely, respond more aggressively to deviations from target inflation,\u201d the authors say. China\u2019s growing role in cross-border rescue lending China\u2019s role as an international lender of last resort has grown exponentially in recent years, according to Sebastian Horn of the World Bank and co-authors. Since 2000, more than 20 debtor countries \u2014 primarily debtors of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative \u2014 have received $240 billion USD from the People\u2019s Bank of China in rescue lending \u2014 $170 billion USD via a global swap line that is quickly growing, and $70 billion USD in rescue loans for balance of payments support. Of this, $185 billion USD was lent between 2016 and 2021. China\u2019s overseas lending, the authors say, is making the international financial system more multipolar, less institutionalized, and less transparent. Chart of the week: Core services inflation remains high Chart courtesy of Jason Furman Quote of the week: \u201cWith financial instability contained, monetary policy should remain focused on bringing inflation down, but stand ready to quickly adjust to financial developments. A silver lining is that the banking turmoil will help slow aggregate activity as banks curtail lending. In and of itself, this should partially mitigate the need for further monetary tightening to achieve the same policy stance. But any expectation that central banks will prematurely surrender the inflation fight would have the opposite effect: lowering yields, supporting activity beyond what is warranted, and ultimately complicating the task of monetary authorities. Fiscal policy can also play an active role. By cooling off economic activity, tighter fiscal policy would support monetary policy, allowing real interest rates to return faster to a low natural level. Appropriately designed fiscal consolidation will also help rebuild much needed buffers and help strengthen financial stability. While fiscal policy is turning less expansionary in many countries this year, more could be done to regain fiscal space,\u201d says Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Economic Counsellor of the International Monetary Fund. \u201cOur latest projections also indicate an overall slowdown in medium-term growth forecasts. Five-year ahead growth projections declined steadily from 4.6% in 2011 to 3% in 2023. Some of this decline reflects the growth slowdown of previously rapidly growing economies such as China or Korea. This is predictable: growth slows down as countries converge. But some of the more recent slowdown may also reflect more ominous forces: the scarring impact of the pandemic, a slower pace of structural reforms, as well as the rising and increasingly real threat of geoeconomic fragmentation leading to more trade tensions, less direct investment, and a slower pace of innovation and technology adoption across fragmented \u2018blocks.\u2019 A fragmented world is unlikely to achieve progress for all, or to successfully tackle global challenges such as climate change or pandemic preparedness. We must avoid that path at all costs.\u201d The Brookings Institution is financed through the support of a diverse array of foundations, corporations, governments, individuals, as well as an endowment.

                  "content": "By David Kiron, Elizabeth J. Altman, Christoph RiedlCompanies increasingly rely on an extended workforce (e.g., contractors, gig workers, professional service firms, complementor organizations, and technologies such as algorithmic management and artificial intelligence) to achieve strategic goals and objectives.1 When we ask leaders to describe how they define their workforce today, they mention a diverse array of participants, beyond just full- and part-time employees, all contributing in various ways. Many of these leaders observe that their extended workforce now comprises 30-50% of their entire workforce. For example, Novartis has approximately 100,000 employees and counts more than 50,000 other workers as external contributors.2 Businesses are also increasingly using crowdsourcing platforms to engage external participants in the development of products and services.34 Managers are thinking about their workforce in terms of who contributes to outcomes, not just by workers\u2019 employment arrangements.5 Our ongoing research on workforce ecosystems demonstrates that managing work across organizational boundaries with groups of interdependent actors in a variety of employment relationships creates new opportunities and risks for both workers and businesses.6 These are not subtle shifts. We define a workforce ecosystem as:7 A structure that encompasses actors, from within the organization and beyond, working to create value for an organization. Within the ecosystem, actors work toward individual and collective goals with interdependencies and complementarities among the participants. The emergence of workforce ecosystems has implications for management theory, organizational behavior, social welfare, and policymakers. In particular, issues surrounding work and worker flexibility, equity, and data governance and transparency pose substantial opportunities for policymaking. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014which we define broadly to include machine learning and algorithmic management\u2014is playing an increasingly large role within the corporate context. The widespread use of AI is already displacing workers through automation, augmenting human performance at work, and creating new job categories. What\u2019s more, AI is enabling, driving, and accelerating the emergence of workforce ecosystems. Workforce ecosystems are incorporating human-AI collaboration on both physical and cognitive tasks and introducing new dependencies among managers, employees, contingent workers, other service providers, and AI. Clearly, policy needs to consider how AI-based automation will affect workers and the labor market more broadly. However, focusing only on the effects of automation without considering the impact of AI on organizational and governance structures understates the extent to which AI is already influencing work, workers, and the practice of management. Policy discussions also need to consider the implications of human-AI collaborations and AI that enhances human performance (such as generative AI tools). Policymakers require a much more nuanced and comprehensive view of the dynamic relationship between workforce ecosystems and AI. To that end, this policy brief presents a framework that addresses the convergence of AI and workforce ecosystems. Within workforce ecosystems, the use of AI is changing the design of work, the supply of labor, the conduct of work, and the measurement of work and workers. Examining AI-related shifts in four categories\u2014Designing Work, Supplying Workers, Conducting Work, and Measuring Work and Workers\u2014reveals a variety of policy implications. We explore these policy considerations, highlighting themes of flexibility, equity, and data governance and transparency. Furthermore, we offer a broad view of how a shift toward workforce ecosystems and the increasing use of AI is influencing the future of work. AI and Workforce Ecosystems: A Framework Workforce ecosystems consist of workforce participants inside and outside organizations crossing all organizational levels and functions and spanning all product and service development and delivery phases. Strikingly, AI usage within workforce ecosystems is increasing and simultaneously accelerating their emergence and growth. The increasing shift toward workforce ecosystems creates new opportunities to leverage AI, and the increased use of AI further amplifies the move toward workforce ecosystems. In this brief, we present a typology to better understand the interaction between the continuing emergence of AI and the ongoing evolution of workforce ecosystems. With this framework, we aim to assist policymakers in making sense of changes accompanying AI\u2019s growth. The typology includes four categories highlighting four areas in which AI is impacting workforce ecosystems: Designing Work, Supplying Workers, Conducting Work, and Measuring Work and Workers. Each of the four categories suggests distinct (if related) policy implications. One overarching implication of this discussion is that policy for work-related AI applications is not limited to addressing automation. Despite the clear need for policy to consider implications arising from the use of AI to automate jobs and displace workers, it is insufficient to focus policy discussions only on automation and not fully consider changes in which human work is augmented by AI and in which humans and AI collaborate. Discussions omitting these factors run the risk of understating the current and future influence of AI on work, workers, and the practice of management. Policy related to AI in workforce ecosystems should balance workers\u2019 interests in sustainable and decent jobs with employers\u2019 interests in productivity and economic growth. If done properly, there is tremendous potential to leverage AI to improve working conditions, worker safety, and worker mobility/flexibility, and to work more collectively and intelligently.8 The goal of these policy refinements should be to allow businesses to meet competitive challenges while limiting the risk of dehumanizing workers, discrimination, and inequality. Policy can offer incentives to limit the use of AI in low value-added contexts, such as for automation of work with small efficiency gains, while promoting higher value-added uses of AI that increase economic productivity and employment growth.9 Designing Work The growing use of AI has a profound effect on work design in workforce ecosystems. A greater supply of AI affects how organizations design work while changes in work design drive greater demand for AI. For example, modern food delivery platforms like GrubHub and DoorDash use AI for sophisticated scheduling, matching, rating, and routing, which has essentially redesigned work within the food delivery industry. Without AI, such crowd-based work designs would not be possible. These technologies and their impact on work design reach beyond food delivery into other supply chains wherever complex delivery systems exist. Similarly, AI-driven tools enable larger, flatter, more integrated teams because entities can coordinate and collaborate more effectively. For workforce ecosystems, this means organizations can more seamlessly integrate external workers, partner organizations, and employees as they strive to meet strategic goals. On the flip side, changes in work design drive increasing demand for AI. For example, as jobs are disaggregated into tasks and work becomes more modular and/or project-based, algorithms can help humans become more effective.10 As companies refine their approach to designing work, they gain access to more data (e.g., in medical research and marketing analytics) and AI becomes even more valuable. Policy concerns associated with U.S. business\u2019s increasing reliance on contingent labor date back (at least to) the 1994 Dunlop Commission.11 Companies do not want to overcommit to hiring full-time workers with skills that will soon become obsolete and thus prefer to rely on contingent labor in many cases. They design work for maximum flexibility and productivity but not necessarily for maximum economic security for workers.12 The shift in employment away from (full- and part-time) payroll to more flexible categories (e.g., contingent workers such as long-term contractors or short-term gig workers) tends to increase the income and wealth gap between workers in full- and part-time employed positions and those in contracted roles by affecting what leverage and protection is available for various classes of workers.13 Notably, contingent work has a direct relationship with \u201cprecarious work.\u201d Precarious work has been defined as work that is \u201cuncertain, unstable, and insecure and in which employees bear the risks of work [\u2026] and receive limited social benefits and statutory protections.\u201d14 This is likely to affect workers of different skills in different ways, leading not only to income and wealth inequality but also to human capital inequality as workers with different skill levels have more or less control over their wages. For example, a highly-skilled data scientist may command a premium and may work for more than one client. In the shipping industry, most of the workers who maintain and operate commercial vessels are contractors, but they are less likely to command a premium nor will they be able to offer their services to multiple clients. Flexible, platform-based work arrangements can result in precarious work arrangements for some workers while giving flexibility, higher wages, and the ability to hyper-specialize to others. This creates human capital inequality. The difference may depend on already existing discrepancies like class, race, and gender, and thus further amplify income and wealth inequality. The growing sophistication of AI makes it easier for managers to source, vet, and hire contingent labor. This new role for AI enables managers to design work in new ways. Instead of focusing on hiring employees and filling in skill gaps with full-time labor, managers are increasingly turning to external talent markets and staffing platforms as a source of shorter-term, skills-based engagements to achieve outcomes. Managers can disaggregate existing jobs into component tasks and then use AI to access external contributors with specific skills to accomplish those tasks. Policy considerations for designing work These changes in work design affect policies for tax, labor, and technology. Federal and state governments should consider developing more inclusive and flexible policies that support all kinds of employment models so workers receive equal protection and benefits based on the value they create, not the employment status they hold. If workers are to be afforded protections that ensure sustainable, safe, and healthy work environments, the same protections should be available to all workers regardless of whether they are an employee or a contingent worker. Unemployment insurance should be modernized to expand eligibility to include workers who do not work (or seek work) full-time and to provide flexible, partial unemployment benefits. Today, firms themselves may be willing to be more flexible and creative with compensation and benefits schemes, but they sometimes only have limited opportunities to do so because of labor regulation constraints. Modernized unemployment and other labor policies would potentially increase contingent workers\u2019 access to reasonable earning opportunities, social safety nets, and benefits. Beyond unemployment insurance, other benefits including retirement savings contributions, health insurance, and medical, family, and parental leaves are similarly restricted to full-time workers for historical reasons (although the restrictions vary across geographic regions). Policies should be updated to allow portability of benefits between employers and improve access to assistance, which would dampen the income volatility faced by many contingent workers. Supplying Workers By using AI to increase the supply of workers of more types (e.g., contractors, gig workers) through improved communication, coordination, and matching, workforce ecosystems can grow more easily, effectively, and efficiently. At the same time, the growth of workforce ecosystems increases the demand for all kinds of workers, leading to more demand for AI to help increase and manage worker supply. Organizations increasingly require a variety of workers to engage in multiple ways (full-time, part-time, as professional service providers, as long- and short-term contractors, etc.). They can use AI to assist in sourcing these workers, for example, by using both internal and external labor platforms and talent marketplaces to find and match workers more effectively.15 Using AI that includes enhanced matching functions, scheduling, recruiting, planning, and evaluations increases access to a diverse corps of workers. Organizations can use AI to more effectively build workforce ecosystems that both align with specific business needs and help meet diversity goals. Increasing the use of AI can have both negative and positive consequences for supplying workers. For example, it can perpetuate or reduce bias in hiring.16 Similarly, AI systems can help ensure pay equity (by identifying and correcting gender differences in pay for similar jobs) or contribute to inequity throughout the workforce ecosystem by, for example, amplifying the value of existing skills while reducing the value of other skills.17 In workforce ecosystems where certain skills are becoming more highly valued, AI can efficiently and objectively verify and validate existing skills and find opportunities for workers to gain new skills. However, on the negative side, such public worker evaluations can lead to lasting consequences when errors are introduced into the verification process and workers have little recourse for correcting them.18 While supplying work is distinct from designing work, the boundaries between the two are porous. For example, an organization may redesign a job into modular pieces and then use an AI-powered talent marketplace to source workers to accomplish these smaller jobs. An organization could break one job into 10 discrete tasks and engage 10 people instead of one via an online labor market such as Amazon Mechanical Turk or Upwork. Further, if an organization can increasingly use AI to effectively source workers (including human and technological workers such as software bots), the organization can design work to leverage a more abundant, diverse, and flexible worker supply. Because organizations can increasingly find people (and partner organizations) to engage for shorter-term, specific assignments, they can more easily build complex and interconnected workforce ecosystems to accomplish business objectives. Policy considerations for supplying workers Policy plays multiple roles in AI-enabled workforce ecosystems related to supplying workers. We consider three sets of issues: tax policy favoring capital over labor investment; relatively inflexible existing educational policies associated with training and development; and, collective bargaining. First, policy shapes incentives for automation relative to human labor. Current U.S. tax policy has relatively high taxation of labor and relatively lower taxation of capital, which can favor automation.19 While this can benefit the remaining workers in heavily automated industries, it can provide incentives to organizations to invest in automation technologies that displace human workers. These automation investments are unlikely to be effectively constrained by taxes on robots, however.20 We need policy incentives that actually make investments in human capital and labor more attractive. These could include tax incentives for upskilling and reskilling both employees and external contributors, creating decent jobs programs, or developing programs to calibrate investments in automation and human labor.21 Second, public and private organizations can collaborate more closely on worker training and continuous learning. Organizations can build relationships across communities to provide training, reskilling, and lifelong learning for workers, especially because current regulations in some geographies, including the U.S., preclude organizations from providing training to contractual workers.22 Public-private partnerships can help enable good jobs and fair work arrangements, provide career opportunities to workers, and add economic benefits for employers. Education needs to become more flexible to provide workers with fresh skills beyond, and in some cases in place of, college. AI can be utilized not only to decompose jobs into component tasks but also to provide support for team formation and career management.23 Digital learning and digital credential and reputation systems are likely to play a key role in enabling a more flexible and comprehensive worker supply. All of these measures would support the continued growth and success of workforce ecosystems across industries and economies. Finally, policymakers should clarify the role that collective bargaining can serve in negotiating issues such as the use of technology, safety, privacy concerns, plans to expand automation, and training and access to training (e.g., paid time off to complete training) among others. Ideally, these benefits can be expanded to include all workers across an ecosystem, not just those in traditional full-time employment. Conducting Work In workforce ecosystems, humans and AI work together to create value, with varying levels of interdependency and control over one another. As stated by MIT Professor Thomas Malone:24 People have the most control when machines act only as tools; and machines have successively more control as their roles expand to assistants, peers, and, finally, managers. Policy should cover the full range of interactions that exist when humans and AI collaborate. Although these categories\u2014assistants, peers, and managers\u2014clearly overlap, each type of working relationship suggests new policy demands for conducting work. AI-as-Assistant. AI supports individual performance within workforce ecosystems. Businesses are increasingly relying on augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) technologies, for instance, to enhance individual and team performance. These technologies promise to improve worker safety in some workplace environments.25 However, new technologies also promise to allow AI-enabled workplace avatars to interact, bringing very human predilections, both prosocial and antisocial, into digital environments.26 AI-as-Peer: Humans and AI increasingly work together as collaborators in workforce ecosystems, using complementary capabilities to achieve outcomes: 60% of human workers already see AI as a co-worker.27 In hospitals, radiologists and AI work together to develop more accurate radiologic interpretations than either alone could accomplish. At law firms, algorithms are taking over elements of the arduous process of due diligence for mergers and acquisitions, analyzing thousands of documents for relevant terms, freeing associates to focus on higher-value assignments.28 AI-as-Manager: AI is already being used to direct a wide range of human behaviors in the workplace, deciding, for example, who to hire, promote, or reassign. Uber uses algorithms to assign and schedule rides, set wages, and track performance; and, AI may direct a warehouse worker\u2019s hand movement with haptic feedback based on motion sensors. AI is also being used in surveillance applications, which can be considered a form of supervision or management.29 Policy considerations for conducting work To address issues related to AI as an assistant or peer, the U.S. needs regulation for workplace safety when humans collaborate with AI agents and robots. These regulations will likely cut across existing government regulatory structures. For example, if AI assistants or robots on a factory floor need to meet cybersecurity requirements to ensure worker safety, are these standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or some other body? In OSHA\u2019s A-Z website index, there is currently no mention of cybersecurity. A key issue with AI-as-manager is that AI decisions may appear opaque and confusing, leaving workers guessing about how and why certain decisions were made and what they can do when bad data skew decisions. For example, unreasonable passengers may give low marks to rideshare drivers, which in turn adversely affects drivers\u2019 income opportunities. Policymakers could pass rules to increase transparency for workers about how algorithmic management decisions are made. Such rules could force employers and online labor platform businesses to disclose which data is used for which decisions. This would be helpful to counteract the current information asymmetry between platforms and workers. Finally, policymakers need to consider how existing anti-discrimination rules intended to regulate human decisions can be applied to algorithms and human-AI teams. Currently, algorithm-based discrimination is difficult to verify and prove given the absence of independent reviews and outside audits.3031 Such audits could help address (and possibly alleviate) unintended consequences when algorithms inadvertently exploit natural human frailties and use flawed data sets. Policymakers could mandate outside audits, establish which data can be used, support research that attempts to assess algorithmic properties, promote research on both algorithmic fairness and machine learning algorithms with provable attributes, and analyze the economic impact of human and AI collaboration. Additionally, policies seeking to reduce discrimination may need to wrestle with which bias\u2014a human\u2019s or an algorithm\u2019s\u2014is the most important bias to minimize. Measuring Work and Workers Firms are increasingly using AI to measure behaviors and performance that were once impossible to track. Advanced measurement techniques have the potential to generate efficiency gains and improve conditions for workers, but they also risk dehumanizing workers and increasing discrimination in the workplace. AI\u2019s ability to reduce the cost of data collection and analysis has greatly expanded the range of possible monitoring to include location, movement, biometrics, affect, as well as verbal and non-verbal communication. For example, AI can predict mood, personality, and emergent leadership in group meetings.32 Workers may experience such tools as intrusive even if the monitoring itself is lawful and even if workers do not directly experience the surveillance. At the same time, workers can use newly available AI systems to assess their performance in real-time and prescribe efficient actions, balance stress, and improve performance.33 Fine-grained, real-time measures may be particularly useful because they can improve processes that support collective intelligence.34 For example, AI that detects emotional shifts on phone calls may enable pharmacists to deal more effectively with customer aggravations;35 biometric sensors for workers in physical jobs can detect strenuous movements and reduce the risk of injury.36 Workers may welcome AI that augments performance and improves safety. On the other hand, a firm\u2019s desire to utilize AI for work and worker measurement poses a risk of treating workers more like machines than humans and introducing AI-based discrimination. Policy considerations for measuring work and workers Policymakers need to recognize that AI is changing the nature of surveillance beyond the regulatory scope of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA), which is the only federal law that directly governs the monitoring of electronic communications in the workplace.37 Surveillance affects not only traditional employees but also contingent workers participating in workforce ecosystems. And, in many cases, contracted workers may be subject to more, and more intrusive, monitoring than other workers, especially when working in remote locations. Three specific areas stand out as particularly relevant. Transparency: To ensure decent work, data transparency is especially crucial as tracking workers (both inside a physical location and also digitally for remote workers) can be disrespectful and violate their privacy. Currently, it is rarely clear to workers what types of data are being used to measure their performance and determine compensation and task assignment. Stories abound in which workers try to game the system by figuring out how to get the most lucrative assignments.38Policymakers need to establish legitimate purposes for data collection and use as well as guidelines for how these need to be shared with workers. They must address the risks of invasive work surveillance and discriminatory practices resulting from algorithmic management and AI systems. Guidelines for data security, privacy, ownership, sharing, and transparency should be much more specifically addressed across regulatory environments. AI Bias: Bias in algorithmic management within traditional organizations and workforce ecosystems can arise from three sources: (a) data that is used to train AI that may include human biases; (b) biased decisionmaking by software developers (who may reflect a narrow portion of the population); and (c) AI that is too rigid to detect situations in which different behavior is warranted (i.e., swerving to avoid a pothole may indicate attentive driving as opposed to inattentive). To further complicate matters, AI itself can develop software, which might introduce other biases. Equity: Employment arrangements become increasingly flexible and fluid in workforce ecosystems, and worker employment status can determine the type of monitoring. Contingent workers in a workforce ecosystem for example might be monitored in ways that employees performing similar tasks would not be. Similar inequities exist even among employees. For instance, with the growth of remote work, various types of monitoring on all employees seems to be on the rise; however, employees working from home may be subject to surveillance different from those in the office.39 Indeed, the threat of surveillance can be used to encourage a return to the workplace. Aside from the question of whether organizational culture can benefit from a threat-induced return to work, there is a substantive question about whether businesses should be allowed to selectively protect or exploit privacy among employees performing similar jobs. To address possible discriminatory practices, policymakers need to establish rules for legitimate data collection and use and for equitable protections of privacy in different work arrangements. At the same time, those policies need to be carefully balanced against the need for work and worker flexibility, innovation, and economic growth. Conclusion Corporate uses of AI are transforming the design and conduct of work, the supply of labor, and the measurement of work and workers. At the same time, companies are increasingly dependent on a wide range of actors, employees and beyond, to accomplish work. The intersection of these two trends has more consequential and broad policy implications than automation in the workplace. Today, many of the protections and benefits workers receive still depend on their classification as an employee versus a contingent worker. We need policies that can: anticipate and account for a variety of work arrangements to ensure safety and equity for workers across categories; accommodate increasingly novel work arrangements that support and protect all workers; balance workers\u2019 desires for decent jobs with organizations\u2019 needs for sustainability and economic growth. All of this needs to be accomplished while policymakers keep a careful eye on unintended consequences. Both AI technologies and firm practices are developing rapidly, making it difficult to predict which future work arrangements may be most successful in which circumstances. Hence, decisionmakers should strive to develop policies that increase rather than constrain innovation for future work arrangements that benefit both workers and organizations. Policymakers should explicitly allow experimentation and learning while limiting regulatory complexity associated with AI in workforce ecosystems.",

TRANSCRIPT [music] STOCK: I\u2019m Jim Stock, coeditor of the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, the semiannual academic conference and journal that pairs rigorous research with real time policy analysis to address the most urgent economic challenges of the day. On behalf of my coeditor Jan Eberly of Northwestern University, as well as the rest of the Brookings team, I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us for this episode of the Brookings Podcast on Economic Activity. Here we share conversations with leading economists on the research they do and how it will affect economic policy. On this episode, you\u2019ll hear from Deborah Lucas of MIT and Gee Hee Hong of the International Monetary Fund and their new paper, \u201cCOVID credit policies around the world: Size, scope, costs and consequences.\u201d They\u2019ll be interviewed by Wendy Edelberg of the Hamilton Project. Governments have long used credit policies to complement standard fiscal policies. Credit policies include things like subsidizing or guaranteeing loans and loan forbearance. The United States in particular, made significant use of credit policies during the COVID pandemic, for example, through the Paycheck Protection Program. Looking forward as fiscal capacity gets stretched in many countries, it\u2019s plausible that governments will increasingly look towards credit policies as tools for achieving broader policy goals. The expansion of credit policies raises many questions, starting with how large they are and how effective they are. This is a vast research program, and Lucas and Hong take an important first step by examining credit policies during the COVID pandemic. They have quite a few interesting findings, and I hope you enjoy this episode. I\u2019ll now hand it over to Wendy, Deborah and Gee Hee. EDELBERG: Thank you, Jim. I am Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project at Brookings. And joining me today is Gee Hee Hong, an economist at the Fiscal Affairs Department at the International Monetary Fund, and Debbie Lucas, the Sloan Distinguished Professor of Finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management and director of the MIT Golub Center for Finance and Policy. We\u2019ll be discussing their new paper, which they presented at the Spring 2023 Brookings Paper on Economic Activity Conference in Washington, D.C. So first, let me say thank you, Gee Hee and Debbie, for joining me today. So, Gee Hee, let\u2019s start with you. You guys both analyzed the size and effect of many types of credit policies used by countries during the height of the pandemic. Can you describe for our listeners some of those policies? HONG: Sure. First of all, Wendy, thank you very much for having us. So, if we go back to what happened in 2020, in the face of an unprecedented public health crisis, governments imposed lockdown measures to limit economic activity which actually jeopardized people\u2019s livelihoods and the survival of businesses. So, to support households and firms, governments introduced a flurry of measures. And in this paper, we are focusing on credit policies such as credit guarantee programs, governments direct lending to households and firms, as well as large scale loan forbearance and payment moratoria programs, which actually allowed borrowers to stop making payments on mortgages, rents, and student loans, for instance. And this was a crucial pillar of government support during COVID. Countries made available more than $6 trillion at the global level. But despite this sheer size, we noticed that credit policies are often underappreciated in the literature and more importantly, in the narrative when we talk about the economic impact of macro policies introduced during COVID. So, this is, in our view, one important contribution of our paper to recognize the important role credit policies played during the pandemic and perhaps in the years that follow. EDELBERG: Yeah. I think your paper is going to be an amazing resource in that regard. Debbie, let\u2019s bring you in. So, your paper talks about the challenges of sizing these policies. Can you walk us through why that\u2019s more complicated than that just looking at the dollars appropriated by policymakers or looking at total amounts of loans or something like that? LUCAS: Thanks, Wendy, for asking about that. In fact, an important message of our paper is that official government statistics all too often entirely fail to measure or mismeasure the size and cost of these credit policies. In fact, the lack of reliable and readily available official statistics we think is an important reason, maybe the most important reason, that economists typically haven\u2019t tried to quantify the effects of credit policies on a macroeconomic scale. To quote an old saw, what isn\u2019t measured isn\u2019t seen. So, an important part of what we do in this paper and in some of our other recent work is to produce statistics on the size and cost of the credit programs that are suitable for macroeconomic analysis. I also want to emphasize that there\u2019s not a one size fits all statistic for these programs. Certainly one aspect is the size of their budgetary cost or equivalently the associated government subsidies that are conveyed to borrowers. A second aspect and the one we focus on most in this paper is related to how much funding that households and firms obtain through these programs. So, just to contrast the two, in most instances the cost or the subsidy is much smaller than the funding obtained because much of the borrowing is going to be eventually repaid. But you asked specifically about why appropriations aren\u2019t an adequate measure. I guess the simplest answer is that the authorized size of these programs in the U.S. and elsewhere significantly exceeds the amounts of funds they provided. That\u2019s what we call \u201ctake up.\u201d You also astutely mentioned the total amount of loans made is irrelevant. In fact, that\u2019s what we\u2019re striving to measure for loan guarantees and direct lending programs. The idea is that those amounts are at least as a first approximation similar in their stimulus effects to that of traditional fiscal policy. But unfortunately, those statistics are just not commonly reported, at least not centrally reported. We found data on take up from a variety of sources, including reports by the agencies administering the programs. We found the situation to be even more complicated for the large scale forbearance programs. Many of those arose outside of the normal appropriation process, and there\u2019s typically extremely little information that\u2019s made publicly available. So, measuring the amount of additional funds obtained with forbearance is more complicated and also requires some assumptions and some financial math to take into account that it\u2019s the missed payments not the take up that\u2019s the relevant concept for measuring the potential stimulus arising from those programs. EDELBERG: So, the title of your paper includes \u201csize, scope, costs, and consequences,\u201d that you set a difficult task for yourself. Tell me about the findings that you want the listeners to know? LUCAS: Well, we found that these credit policies, when they\u2019re properly measured, significantly increase the resources in the pockets of firms and households. It brought the average share of funds obtained from 14 and a half percent of GDP when you only look at fiscal policies, to 22% when all of these credit and forbearance policies are added on top of traditional fiscal measures. What was maybe the most striking to us and something we certainly weren\u2019t expecting is the very different picture one gets of the relative aggressiveness of government policies across these countries. So, whereas there\u2019s considerable variation in the use of traditional fiscal policies\u2014and notably the U.S. looks particularly aggressive by that measure\u2014if you look at the cross-country variation, it\u2019s much lower when credit and forbearance policies are also taken into account. Now, in terms of the macroeconomic effects of these policies, we also find some interesting results. Although I must say that the sample size is just seven countries and this one episode, so we can\u2019t draw any formal inferences. But with that disclaimer, a finding that was quite suggestive of the importance of credit support and forbearance policies is that there\u2019s a much stronger positive correlation between the cross section of real GDP growth in late 2020 through late 2021 when you look at the broad measure that includes credit programs then if you just look at fiscal spending alone. We also find that the very elevated savings rates during 2020 and 2021 are highly correlated with the combined funds provided by credit and fiscal policies. We also wanted to explore the connection between credit policy and inflation. We don\u2019t find that including credit policies helps to directly explain the cross section of inflation across these countries. But we\u2019d conjecture that the much higher and more uniform levels of incremental resources provided by European and U.S. governments and the likelihood that a significant fraction of all of these resources were initially saved rather than spent is at least consistent with pandemic fiscal and credit policies having significantly contributed to the sharp increase in subsequent inflation in all of these countries. EDELBERG: Debbie, one more question for you. So, you talked about the importance of take up in in your measurements. So, one factor I know that was important in the U.S. just from other work that I\u2019ve done was that some sectors of the economy bounced back very quickly and the size of fiscal support going to households meant tremendous support for spending. So, how do you think about the relationship between credit policies in 2020 and in 2021 and other fiscal policies? I guess what I\u2019m trying to get at is if businesses saw enormous demand for their products because of the fiscal support going to households that helped to support spending, how do you think about the interplay between those kinds of fiscal support for households and take up for these loans by businesses and the like? LUCAS: Yeah, that\u2019s a great question. I just want to actually first note that in responding to the pandemic, the U.S. actually relied much less heavily on credit support than did all of the other countries we studied. In fact, the U.S. primarily depended on the fiscal policies that you just mentioned. However, what the U.S. did was for the first time they introduced these large scale forbearance programs, particularly for government backed mortgages and for student loans. And, you know, those forbearance policies we estimated represented a pretty modest fraction of GDP, about six-tenths of 1%. Those programs also helped people that were struggling to meet those fixed expenses, much as expanded unemployment insurance or the checks sent to households did. So, I would say that those forbearance policies complemented some of the fiscal stimulus that was provided. Interesting in the U.S. context is that it was possible to authorize those policies without any congressional action because they affected existing government loan programs where there was already administrative authority to provide forbearance. So, that\u2019s something special to the U.S., which lets them get money out the door quite quickly by introducing forbearance policies. EDELBERG: Gee Hee, I have a question for you about take up and whether or not take up may underestimate how important credit programs are. So, some have argued that even for credit programs that had little take up\u2014and here, just for context, what I\u2019m thinking about is like some of the Fed programs, credit programs in the U.S. that had very little take up\u2014some have argued that even though those programs may have had very little take up, their existence was hugely important for confidence, just for example. So, does that sound right? And then how should we how should we then think about that channel of credit programs mattering in the context of all of your findings? HONG: That\u2019s a great question, Wendy. To be clear, I think there is an element in any policy announcements that will affect sentiment. And as you mentioned, the Fed credit program, or the central bank liquidity facilities, of government providing a backstop when uncertainty is high, they will certainly boost confidence in the market. But for credit policies, we think that households and firms may be more interested in perhaps in actually using these policies because they will directly alleviate their debt burdens or relax their credit constraints, for instance. So, in that context, the aspect that interested us more was the design of policy. For instance, how terms of guarantees and forbearance were designed and how they made programs attractive so that economic agents would actually use them. EDELBERG: So, let me throw this question wide open to both of you and thinking that our listeners are probably maybe even more focused on the financial system right now than at other times, what are your findings telling you about policy going forward? Like, should credit policies be used alongside conventional monetary policy and fiscal policy? Like, how important is this in policymakers\u2019 toolkits? HONG: So, in our paper, our findings suggest that these credit policies can be a very powerful tool to support households and businesses, potentially at a much lower cost than other traditional fiscal measures. But these needs to be very carefully designed and well targeted. And in our view, going forward credit policies are likely to play a more prominent role because if you think about countries facing limited fiscal space with high levels of debt and spending to rise further to tackle various, for instance, short-term and long-term challenges like climate agenda, credit policies are going to be a very attractive option for governments to continue to support the economy without overburdening the budget. So, this means that the credit policy will continue to play a more important role, but also at the same time, there should be a caution that they should pay more attention and recognize that the budget cost of the fiscal risks related to the programs. LUCAS: Thanks, Gee Hee. I\u2019d agree with a lot of what you said, but my bottom line is that credit policy should be used only with extreme caution. You mentioned that credit support programs can be effective, but I would say that\u2019s really only clearly true during episodes where there\u2019s a breakdown in the functioning of private credit markets or also as a way to help target beneficiaries like students and small businesses with limited access on their own to credit markets and that wouldn\u2019t be able to obtain credit without government support. But I think that all too often these policies are used in preference to more transparent forms of assistance. Not only do they hide the upfront costs of providing credit, but they leave governments exposed to considerable future financial risk. That risk is, for instance, that guarantees will be called upon when the economy is very weak, when fiscal resources are already very strained. And so, I also think that now that these credit policies have become more normalized by their aggressive rollout during the pandemic, it\u2019s likely they, in fact, will be adopted more readily in future crises. So, to prepare for that, I think governments need to revamp their disclosures about credit policies and make their costs and risks much more transparent. And I\u2019m hoping that the economics profession will help them in getting there. EDELBERG: So, Debbie and Gee Hee, you both talked about the use of credit programs, both during times of crisis, but also during times when markets are just not complete and households or businesses don\u2019t have access to credit, which may be occurring, obviously, outside of times of crisis. So, Debbie, you\u2019ve alluded to this, but can I draw you out a little bit more to draw the distinction between when credit programs should be used simply in a time of crisis or when credit programs might be appropriate, just as a more structural part of fiscal policy. LUCAS: Yeah. Thanks, Wendy. So, I personally believe that these programs should only be used to correct market imperfections. And the reason for that is because of their lack of transparency. And, the fact that they\u2019re mostly outside of the budget process makes them very undisciplined. But when they have economic justification is when they\u2019re addressing some kind of an externality or serious problem in the markets. So, there\u2019s episodic problems, like during the global financial crisis where credit markets just stopped functioning. And there was also that concern that it might happen during COVID. So, during a large crisis, there\u2019s a reason for governments to step in and support credit markets to make sure that they continue to function. But other than a severe crisis, as you mentioned, the reason to have credit programs is to correct kind of standing market imperfections that arise because of what you might refer to as incomplete information. So, young borrowers with no credit history, students, or small businesses have limited access to credit. I guess another example is people who want to buy houses who don\u2019t have a lot of credit history might be unable to do so in the completely unregulated private market. So, there is a rationale for governments to come in and support credit for those purposes in a kind of on a kind of standing basis. EDELBERG: This has been a super conversation. And let me just reiterate something I said earlier, which is your paper is going to be just a tremendous resource going forward as we think about not just what role credit programs played during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also how we should be using these programs going forward and be thinking about them and measuring them and thinking about their effectiveness. So, I just want to thank you both for putting in this incredibly hard work to write this paper.

                  "content": "The Bank of Canada is once again holding its key interest rate steady at 4.5 per cent but isn\u2019t ruling out the possibility of more rate hikes down the line. The central bank said Wednesday that recent economic data is reinforcing its confidence that inflation will continue to fall in the coming months. \u201cHowever, getting inflation the rest of the way back down to two per cent could prove to be more difficult,\u201d the Bank of Canada said in a news release. The central bank said its governing council will continue to assess whether interest rates are high enough to bring inflation back to target. Economists were widely anticipating the Bank of Canada to maintain its interest rate as inflation eases meaningfully. Canada\u2019s annual inflation rate fell to 5.2 per cent in February, marking the second month in a row it came in lower than forecast. Related: Bank of Canada holds key rate for first time in a year, leaves door open to hikes The Bank of Canada continues to expect the inflation rate to fall to three per cent by mid-year and back down to two per cent by the end of 2024. Its decision to stay on the sidelines and not raise interest rates further comes as the economy posts stronger-than-expected growth and the labour market remains exceptionally tight \u2013 both signs of a still-hot economy. The Bank of Canada said \u201cdemand is still exceeding supply and the labour market remains tight.\u201d In its quarterly monetary policy report released Wednesday, the central bank\u2019s updated forecasts suggest it expects the economy to still slow, just a little later than previously anticipated. It\u2019s now expecting real gross domestic product to grow by 1.4 per cent this year, up from its previous forecast of 1.0 per cent. Employment in Canada has remained resilient amid high interest rates, with the unemployment rate sitting at five per cent in February, near record lows. Wages are also growing rapidly, raising concern for the Bank of Canada as it works to bring down price growth. For 2024, the Bank of Canada revised growth to 1.3 per cent, down from 1.8 per cent. As foreign demand for Canadian exports strengthens and the effects of past monetary policy tightening fade, the economy is expected to rebound in 2025 and grow by 2.5 per cent. Globally, the Bank of Canada said growth has been stronger than anticipated, also leading to an upward revision to growth this year and a downward revision for next year. Looking ahead, the path back to low inflation and stronger growth in Canada relies on high interest rates working effectively. Since March of last year, the Bank of Canada has aggressively raised its key interest rate to stifle spending in the economy. But after historic monetary policy tightening, the Bank of Canada has hit the brakes. It announced earlier this year it plans to hold its key interest rate steady to allow time for the effects of higher borrowing costs to broaden out in the economy. Given the run-up in prices largely occurred in the first half of 2022, the slowdown in inflation this year was largely expected. However, economists and the central bank are concerned getting exactly back to the two per cent target might be more challenging, with some components of inflation still sticky. The central bank\u2019s concern stems from several factors, including consumers and businesses expecting future inflation to be higher than the Bank of Canada\u2019s forecasts. It\u2019s also concerned about prices for services still rising rapidly \u2013 in part due to rapid wage growth \u2013 and businesses still able to easily pass on higher prices to consumers. The central bank its governing council will be watching these indicators along with core inflation closely, as it sets monetary policy moving forward.",

                  "content": "Traveling with kids can be a great adventure but it may also be filled with many potential pitfalls. Here are some mistakes parents make when exploring the globe with their children and what to do instead.1. Trying To Save Money With A Cheaper Flight Adobe Flights are often the most expensive part of travel with kids. But dont sacrifice your sanity for a small amount of savings. Cheaper itineraries often involve early or late flights plus stops along the way. The more layovers and middle-of-the-night departures you add to your travels, the harder your trip with kids will be.Experts also often discourage treating your almost 2-year-old toddler as a lap child. You save money if you dont buy an extra seat, but you also have an active child on your lap and possibly a very uncomfortable flight. Plus, buying basic economy seats where you dont get to pick your seat assignment may mean youll be separated from your kids. If youve read any social media comment threads about parents asking others to switch seats for their kids, youll know its not guaranteed that another passenger will agree to switch seats with you.2. Not Taking The Right Luggage Adobe The best kids suitcase is easy to tote, can carry what you need, and will last for many trips. Its not the adorable but teeny-tiny carry-on that wont fit much at all.Insiders Alesandra Dubin, recommends skipping gimmicky child suitcases and getting a good quality 20-inch suitcase in a fun color instead. Starting at age 5, her kids also began pulling/carrying their own suitcases/backpacks.DWYM has recommendations for the best kids suitcase.3. Not Bringing Car Seats Onto The Plane Adobe Lugging car seats around an airport and onto a flight seems like a hassle, but I know from personal experience that they are worth the trouble. My kids slept better in them when they were small.The Car Seat Lady points out that children are used to traveling in car seats and often feel more secure in them, even on a plane. When left to flop around freely in an airplane seat, my kiddos tended to be squirmy and restless.Taking your airline-approved car seat on the plane also prevents any damage to it while in cargo or as its being carried to and from the gate for stowage. When you reach your destination, you dont have to figure out how to rent one to drive your kids around.Last but not least, your child is safest on an airplane when buckled into a properly strapped-in car seat.4. Forgetting Carry-On Essentials Adobe Some parents board a plane trusting that in-flight entertainment and onboard food purchases will get them and their kids through a flight. But it seems like airlines continue to cut back on their onboard offerings every year, especially since the pandemic.The Points Guy points out that kids may get hangry if you dont have the right food on hand for them. And sometimes flights arent equipped with seatback screens or apps you can download to your devices. Make sure you pack extra food and entertainment.Dubin recommends bringing extra clothes for you and your kids when they are young, especially if they are prone to motion sickness. She also likes to bring a trash bag to collect the flotsam your children create on a flight (this works for a road trip too).Add in more wipes than youd think you need, hand sanitizer, and the all-important set of headphones to listen to entertainment! And dont forget an extra charger.5. Having The Whole Family Share One Room Adobe You may think a little inconvenience is worth the extra savings youll get if you share one room with your kids. But that savings means that when your kids go down for the night, youre huddled in the bathroom or outside in the hall trying to read or watch TV without waking them.\u00a0 After all, you cant leave your kids alone and go elsewhere.Budget for more space, whether thats a suite-type room, adjoining hotel rooms, or a vacation rental where you can really spread out. A middle-ground option for sharing a room in a warm weather location is to make sure it has a balcony you and your partner can relax on after the kids are in bed.6. Not Planning For Your Kids Pace Adobe Kids need downtime and naps on a trip to avoid meltdowns. They also need time to recover from a change in time zones.The Traveling Canucks say they always plan for their first day at their destination to be an easy day of lounging at the pool, watching movies, or just hanging in the room in order to acclimate.Kendra Thornton of Royal Travel & Tours told The New York Times that travel with kids often works best if you plan a half day of activities and the other half for more open play and relaxation at a park or pool or back at your hotel room.7. Not Making A Plan For If Your Child Gets Lost Adobe Children slip away before you know it in big crowds or unfamiliar areas. Make sure youve talked with your kids about what to do if they ever get lost.Do they know your phone number? My friend Jenn once told me the best hack for getting her children to memorize her phone number. She made the iPad log-in code her cell digits and her kids had it memorized in no time.Police officers, security guards and park employees are good people to tell your kids to look to for help when they are lost. But when those cant be found, some suggest training your kids to seek out a mom or dad (spotted with strollers and kids in tow).Todays Parent and Very Well Family have other tips on helping your kids know what to do if they get lost.8. Eating Out For Every Meal Adobe You can waste a lot of trip time and money dining out for every meal on vacation. Plan to eat at least one meal a day as a grab-and-go deal or back at your lodgings.If youve got picky eaters you know theyll be just as happy with cereal and microwaved mac and cheese made in your hotel room as they would be at a restaurant where the menu options are unfamiliar. And youll save money in the process.Tips for Family Trips has several suggestions on food while traveling, such as looking into a vacation rental with a kitchen or kitchenette where you can make meals yourself. You cut down on costs and your kids can have their end-of-day meltdowns in the privacy of your own space.Traveling with children is an art, not a science, and your own kids personalities as well as your family dynamic will guide how you operate on trips to other places. But these tips can make your life a bit easier and when youre away from home, thats a good thing.This story originally appeared on Don't Waste Your Money.
